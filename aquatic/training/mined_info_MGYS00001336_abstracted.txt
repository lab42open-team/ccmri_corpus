study_name	Effects of organic matter manipulation on bacterial community diversity and function
study_abstract	Lake ecosystems provide important services including their ability to support complex food webs, and their connection to the global carbon cycle. These services are dependent on how microorganisms interact with available organic matter (OM), both dissolved and particulate. Therefore, in order to manage these important ecosystems and their services successfully, it is necessary to understand how the quality and quantity of DOM affects microbial communities. Linking DOM quality and quantity to microbial community complexity and function are crucial steps toward a mechanistic understanding of freshwater ecosystems. Understanding these relationships at the microbial scale will enable us to make predictions about landscape-scale environmental change and its effect on aquatic carbon cycling and food web processes. In this study, I aim to investigate the effect of organic matter manipulation on the molecular structure of DOM and the microbial community composition and function in freshwater boreal lakes.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Invisible to the naked eye lies a tremendous diversity of organic molecules and organisms that make major contributions to important biogeochemical cycles. However, how the diversity and composition of these two communities are interlinked remains poorly characterized in fresh waters, despite the potential for chemical and microbial diversity to promote one another. Here we exploited gradients in chemodiversity within a common microbial pool to test how chemical and biological diversity covary and characterized the implications for ecosystem functioning. We found that both chemodiversity and genes associated with organic matter decomposition increased as more plant litterfall accumulated in experimental lake sediments, consistent with scenarios of future environmental change. Chemical and microbial diversity were also positively correlated, with dissolved organic matter having stronger effects on microbes than vice versa. Under our experimental scenarios that increased sediment organic matter from 5 to 25% or darkened overlying waters by 2.5 times, the resulting increases in chemodiversity could increase greenhouse gas concentrations in lake sediments by an average of 1.5 to 2.7 times, when all of the other effects of litterfall and water color were considered. Our results open a major new avenue for research in aquatic ecosystems by exposing connections between chemical and microbial diversity and their implications for the global carbon cycle in greater detail than ever before.
