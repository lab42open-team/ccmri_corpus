study_abstract	Given the complexity in microbial transformation of arsenic in deep aquifer sediment, we aim to shade light of indigenous bacterial community structure in arsenic-enriched deep aquifer sediment and how the communities changes under controlled redox condition favoring reductive dissolution and release of arsenic from the sediment.
