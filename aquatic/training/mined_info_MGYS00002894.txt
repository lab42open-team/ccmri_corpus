study_name	Nitrate-storing microorganisms in sediments of the Bornholm Basin
study_abstract	The objective of this study is to examine the distribution of nitrate-storing microorganisms along a transect towards deeper water depths in the hypoxic Bornholm Basin. Nitrate-storing microorganisms were identified by amplicon sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of Eukaryotes and diatoms (18S rRNA gene). The organisms that were identified by sequencing were evaluated in regard to their ability and capacity to store intracellular nitrate.
