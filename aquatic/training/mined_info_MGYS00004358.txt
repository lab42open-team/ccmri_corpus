study_abstract	Eubacterial and archaeal community identification in historically contaminated subsurface sediment and community shift during PHC degradation under given experimental conditions. Historically contaminated subsurface sediment was used to monitor hydrocarbon degradation behavoir under sulphate reducing and methanogenic conditions over 450 days. Total RNA was isolated from experimental sets and reverse-transcribed to cDNAs. Phylogenetic marker gene 16S rDNA was amplified with eubacterial and archaeal universal primers and amplicons were sequenced on Roche 454 sequencing platform.
