study_name	Core genomes of cosmopolitan surface ocean plankton
study_abstract	The sunlight surface layer of the ocean is the largest contiguous biome on the planet. The photoautotrophic microbial communities in the ocean fix roughly equal amounts of CO2 through photosynthesis as all terrestrial biomes, despite a widespread paucity of multiple nutrients. The accompanying bacterioplankton communities are important in recycling nutrients for autotrophs, providing or requiring vitamin cofactors, thereby influencing the biogeochemical cycles of important green house gasses N2O, CO2, dimethyl sulfide, and methane. The bacterioplankon communities contain a high level of diversity , particularly of uncultivated organisms with unknown genome contents. Single cell genomics and metagenomic assemblies have characterized the genomes of a few uncultivated organisms , yet a substantial portion of the community remains uncharacterized. Here we report the collection, assembly, and analysis of 225 metagenomes collected from the euphotic zone of every ocean at temperatures from 0?C to 30?C. A global assembly resulted in 3 Gbp of contiguous DNA assemblies, or approximately 100 genomes , representing over 80% of all metagenomic reads. A large majority of the assemblies are cosmopolitan, with over 50% being found in 50% of the metagenomic sites, indicating a widespread genomic commonality between geographicall y separated communities. The emergent genome biogeography illuminates a temperature-driven distribution of genomes at multiple taxonomic levels from strain to phyla, while protein family level analyses at a global and genus level point to nutrient availability dictating finer scale variation. The assemblies provide a genomic characterization of the so-called microbial dark matter in this environment at an unprecedented scale and point to lineage specific metabolic specialization both in core metabolism and nutrient acquisition, a potential niche diversification that leads to metasymbiosis within a complex community.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Unicellular cyanobacteria are ubiquitous photoautotrophic microbes that contribute substantially to global primary production. Picocyanobacteria such as Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus depend on chlorophyll a-binding protein complexes to capture light energy. In addition, Synechococcus has accessory pigments organized into phycobilisomes, and Prochlorococcus contains chlorophyll b. Across a surface water transect spanning the sparsely studied tropical Indian Ocean, we examined Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus occurrence, taxonomy and habitat preference in an evolutionary context. Shotgun sequencing of size fractionated microbial communities from 0.1 mym to 20 mym and subsequent phylogenetic analysis indicated that cyanobacteria account for up to 15% of annotated reads, with the genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus comprising 90% of the cyanobacterial reads, even in the largest size fraction (3.0-20 mm). Phylogenetic analyses of cyanobacterial light-harvesting genes (chl-binding pcb/isiA, allophycocyanin (apcAB), phycocyanin (cpcAB) and phycoerythin (cpeAB)) mostly identified picocyanobacteria clades comprised of overlapping sequences obtained from Indian Ocean, Atlantic and/or Pacific Oceans samples. Habitat reconstructions coupled with phylogenetic analysis of the Indian Ocean samples suggested that large Synechococcus-like ancestors in coastal waters expanded their ecological niche towards open oligotrophic waters in the Indian Ocean through lineage diversification and associated streamlining of genomes (e.g. loss of phycobilisomes and acquisition of Chl b); resulting in contemporary small celled Prochlorococcus. Comparative metagenomic analysis with picocyanobacteria populations in other oceans suggests that this evolutionary scenario may be globally important.
