publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Hypersaline aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems display a cosmopolitan distribution. These environments teem with microbes and harbor a plethora of prokaryotic lineages that evaded ecological characterization due to the prior inability to cultivate them or to access their genomic information. In order to close the current knowledge gap, we performed two sampling and isolation campaigns in the saline soils of the Odiel Saltmarshes and the salterns of Isla Cristina (Huelva, Spain). From the isolated haloarchaeal strains subjected to high-throughput phylogenetic screening, two were chosen (F15B<sup>T</sup> and F9-27<sup>T</sup>) for physiological and genomic characterization due of their relatedness to the genus <i>Halonotius</i>. Comparative genomic analyses were carried out between the isolated strains and the genomes of previously described species <i>Halonotius pteroides</i> CECT 7525<sup>T</sup>, <i>Halonotius aquaticus</i> F13-13<sup>T</sup> and environmentaly recovered metagenome-assembled representatives of the genus <i>Halonotius</i>. The topology of the phylogenomic tree showed agreement with the phylogenetic ones based on 16S rRNA and <i>rpoB'</i> genes, and together with average amino acid and nucleotide identities suggested the two strains as novel species within the genus. We propose the names <i>Halonotius terrestris</i> sp. nov. (type strain F15B<sup>T</sup> = CECT 9688<sup>T</sup> = CCM 8954<sup>T</sup>) and <i>Halonotius roseus</i> sp. nov. (type strain F9-27<sup>T</sup> = CECT 9745<sup>T</sup> = CCM 8956<sup>T</sup>) for these strains. Comparative genomic analyses within the genus highlighted a typical <i>salt-in</i> signature, characterized by acidic proteomes with low isoelectric points, and indicated heterotrophic aerobic lifestyles. Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions revealed that the newly proposed species encode all the necessary enzymatic reactions involved in cobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) biosynthesis. Based on the worldwide distribution of the genus and its abundance in hypersaline habitats we postulate that its members perform a critical function by being able to provide "expensive" commodities (i.e., vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) to the halophilic microbial communities at large.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	The canonical pathway for sucrose metabolism in haloarchaea utilizes a modified Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMP), in which ketohexokinase and 1-phosphofructokinase phosphorylate fructose released from sucrose hydrolysis. However, our survey of haloarchaeal genomes determined that ketohexokinase and 1-phosphofructokinase genes were not present in all species known to utilize fructose and sucrose, thereby indicating that alternative mechanisms exist for fructose metabolism. A fructokinase gene was identified in the majority of fructose- and sucrose-utilizing species, whereas only a small number possessed a ketohexokinase gene. Analysis of a range of hypersaline metagenomes revealed that haloarchaeal fructokinase genes were far more abundant (37 times) than haloarchaeal ketohexokinase genes. We used proteomic analysis of <i>Halohasta litchfieldiae</i> (which encodes fructokinase) and identified changes in protein abundance that relate to growth on sucrose. Proteins inferred to be involved in sucrose metabolism included fructokinase, a carbohydrate primary transporter, a putative sucrose hydrolase, and two uncharacterized carbohydrate-related proteins encoded in the same gene cluster as fructokinase and the transporter. Homologs of these proteins were present in the genomes of all haloarchaea that use sugars for growth. Enzymes involved in the semiphosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway also had higher abundances in sucrose-grown <i>H. litchfieldiae</i> cells, consistent with this pathway functioning in the catabolism of the glucose moiety of sucrose. The study revises the current understanding of fundamental pathways for sugar utilization in haloarchaea and proposes alternatives to the modified EMP pathway used by haloarchaea for sucrose and fructose utilization.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Our ability to infer the function that microorganisms perform in the environment is predicated on assumptions about metabolic capacity. When genomic or metagenomic data are used, metabolic capacity is inferred from genetic potential. Here, we investigate the pathways by which haloarchaea utilize sucrose. The canonical haloarchaeal pathway for fructose metabolism involving ketohexokinase occurs only in a small proportion of haloarchaeal genomes and is underrepresented in metagenomes. Instead, fructokinase genes are present in the majority of genomes/metagenomes. In addition to genomic and metagenomic analyses, we used proteomic analysis of <i>Halohasta litchfieldiae</i> (which encodes fructokinase but lacks ketohexokinase) and identified changes in protein abundance that related to growth on sucrose. In this way, we identified novel proteins implicated in sucrose metabolism in haloarchaea, comprising a transporter and various catabolic enzymes (including proteins that are annotated as hypothetical).

publication_nr_2_pubmed_abstract	Hypersaline environments represent some of the most challenging settings for life on Earth. Extremely halophilic microorganisms have been selected to colonize and thrive in these extreme environments by virtue of a broad spectrum of adaptations to counter high salinity and osmotic stress. Although there is substantial data on microbial taxonomic diversity in these challenging ecosystems and their primary osmoadaptation mechanisms, less is known about how hypersaline environments shape the genomes of microbial inhabitants at the functional level. In this study, we analyzed the microbial communities in five ponds along the discontinuous salinity gradient from brackish to salt-saturated environments and sequenced the metagenome of the salt (halite) precipitation pond in the artisanal Cahuil Solar Saltern system. We combined field measurements with spectrophotometric pigment analysis and flow cytometry to characterize the microbial ecology of the pond ecosystems, including primary producers and applied metagenomic sequencing for analysis of archaeal and bacterial taxonomic diversity of the salt crystallizer harvest pond. Comparative metagenomic analysis of the Cahuil salt crystallizer pond against microbial communities from other salt-saturated aquatic environments revealed a dominance of the archaeal genus <i>Halorubrum</i> and showed an unexpectedly low abundance of <i>Haloquadratum</i> in the Cahuil system. Functional comparison of 26 hypersaline microbial metagenomes revealed a high proportion of sequences associated with nucleotide excision repair, helicases, replication and restriction-methylation systems in all of them. Moreover, we found distinctive functional signatures between the microbial communities from salt-saturated (&gt;30% [w/v] total salinity) compared to sub-saturated hypersaline environments mainly due to a higher representation of sequences related to replication, recombination and DNA repair in the former. The current study expands our understanding of the diversity and distribution of halophilic microbial populations inhabiting salt-saturated habitats and the functional attributes that sustain them.

publication_nr_3_pubmed_abstract	Plasmids PL6A and PL6B are both carried by the C23<sup>T</sup> strain of the square archaeon <i>Haloquadratum walsbyi</i>, and are closely related (76% nucleotide identity), circular, about 6 kb in size, and display the same gene synteny. They are unrelated to other known plasmids and all of the predicted proteins are cryptic in function. Here we describe two additional PL6-related plasmids, pBAJ9-6 and pLT53-7, each carried by distinct isolates of <i>Haloquadratum walsbyi</i> that were recovered from hypersaline waters in Australia. A third PL6-like plasmid, pLTMV-6, was assembled from metavirome data from Lake Tyrell, a salt-lake in Victoria, Australia. Comparison of all five plasmids revealed a distinct plasmid family with strong conservation of gene content and synteny, an average size of 6.2 kb (range 5.8-7.0 kb) and pairwise similarities between 61-79%. One protein (F3) was closely similar to a protein carried by betapleolipoviruses while another (R6) was similar to a predicted AAA-ATPase of His 1 halovirus (His1V_gp16). Plasmid pLT53-7 carried a gene for a FkbM family methyltransferase that was not present in any of the other plasmids. Comparative analysis of all PL6-like plasmids provided better resolution of conserved sequences and coding regions, confirmed the strong link to haloviruses, and showed that their sequences are highly conserved among examples from <i>Haloquadratum</i> isolates and metagenomic data that collectively cover geographically distant locations, indicating that these genetic elements are widespread.

publication_nr_4_pubmed_abstract	Solar salterns are excellent model ecosystems for studying virus-microbial interactions because of their low microbial diversity, environmental stability, and high viral density. By using the power of CRISPR spacers to link viruses to their prokaryotic hosts, we explored virus-host interactions in geographically diverse salterns. Using taxonomic profiling, we identified hosts such as archaeal <i>Haloquadratum</i>, <i>Halorubrum</i>, and <i>Haloarcula</i> and bacterial <i>Salinibacter</i>, and we found that community composition related to not only salinity but also local environmental dynamics. Characterizing glycerol metabolism genes in these metagenomes suggested <i>Halorubrum</i> and <i>Haloquadratum</i> possess most dihydroxyacetone kinase genes while <i>Salinibacter</i> possesses most glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes. Using two different methods, we detected fewer CRISPR spacers in <i>Haloquadratum</i>-dominated compared with Halobacteriaceae-dominated saltern metagenomes. After CRISPR detection, spacers were aligned against haloviral genomes to map virus to host. While most alignments for each saltern metagenome linked viruses to <i>Haloquadratum walsbyi</i>, there were also alignments indicating interactions with the low abundance taxa <i>Haloarcula</i> and <i>Haloferax</i>. Further examination of the dinucleotide and trinucleotide usage differences between paired viruses and their hosts confirmed viruses and hosts had similar nucleotide usage signatures. Detection of <i>cas</i> genes in the salterns supported the possibility of CRISPR activity. Taken together, our studies suggest similar virus-host interactions exist in different solar salterns and that the glycerol metabolism gene dihydroxyacetone kinase is associated with <i>Haloquadratum</i> and <i>Halorubrum</i>.

publication_nr_5_pubmed_abstract	We analyzed the prokaryotic community structure of a saltern pond with 21% total salts located in Isla Cristina, Huelva, Southwest Spain, close to the Atlantic ocean coast. For this purpose, we constructed a metagenome (designated as IC21) obtained by pyrosequencing consisting of 486 Mb with an average read length of 397 bp and compared it with other metagenomic datasets obtained from ponds with 19, 33, and 37% total salts acquired from Santa Pola marine saltern, located in Alicante, East Spain, on the Mediterranean coast. Although the salinity in IC21 is closer to the pond with 19% total salts from Santa Pola saltern (designated as SS19), IC21 is more similar at higher taxonomic levels to the pond with 33% total salts from Santa Pola saltern (designated as SS33), since both are predominated by the phylum Euryarchaeota. However, there are significant differences at lower taxonomic levels where most sequences were related to the genus Halorubrum in IC21 and to Haloquadratum in SS33. Within the Bacteroidetes, the genus Psychroflexus is the most abundant in IC21 while Salinibacter dominates in SS33. Sequences related to bacteriorhodopsins and halorhodopsins correlate with the abundance of Haloquadratum in Santa Pola SS19 to SS33 and of Halorubrum in Isla Cristina IC21 dataset, respectively. Differences in composition might be attributed to local ecological conditions since IC21 showed a decrease in the number of sequences related to the synthesis of compatible solutes and in the utilization of phosphonate.
