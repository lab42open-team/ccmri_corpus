study_name	Photoheterotrophy in a mesoscale anticyclonic eddy in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea
study_abstract	Mesoscale eddies are semi-closed rotating water bodies with distinct physico-chemical properties and are a widespread phenomenon in the world's oceans. Previous studies found that eddies can affect phytoplankton and bacterioplankton community structure, primary productivity and nitrogen fixation. A considerable fraction of the marine bacterioplankton consists of photoheterhophs. These bacteria can use light to generate biochemical energy for transport and metabolic needs. Unlike photoautotrophs they depend on organic carbon for growth and biomass production. Photoheterotrophy can potentially enhance bacterial growth and/or survival in oligotrophic oceanic conditions. A common group of photoheterotrophs consists of proteorhodopsin (pr) bearing bacteria. The pr gene occurs in diverse microbial taxa including SAR11, a dominant Alphaproteobacteria clade. We hypothesize that anticyclonic eddies, which facilitate nutrient poor conditions by downwelling surface water, favor photoheterhophy. In November 2013 we conducted an oceanographic survey aboard R/V Mediterranean Explorer with the goal to assess the abundance, diversity and expression of photoheterophic genes in an anticyclonic eddy in the ultra-oligotrophic Eastern Mediterranean Sea. The results of this study will shed light on the potential role of physical and chemical gradients created by mesoscale eddies on changes in photoheterotrophic communities, which can have global effects on ocean biogeochemistry and energy flow.
