publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The ocean is home to myriad small planktonic organisms that underpin the functioning of marine ecosystems. However, their spatial patterns of diversity and the underlying drivers remain poorly known, precluding projections of their responses to global changes. Here we investigate the latitudinal gradients and global predictors of plankton diversity across archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, and major virus clades using both molecular and imaging data from Tara Oceans. We show a decline of diversity for most planktonic groups toward the poles, mainly driven by decreasing ocean temperatures. Projections into the future suggest that severe warming of the surface ocean by the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century could lead to tropicalization of the diversity of most planktonic groups in temperate and polar regions. These changes may have multiple consequences for marine ecosystem functioning and services and are expected to be particularly significant in key areas for carbon sequestration, fisheries, and marine conservation.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Mixotrophy, or the ability to acquire carbon from both auto- and heterotrophy, is a widespread ecological trait in marine protists. Using a metabarcoding dataset of marine plankton from the global ocean, 318,054 mixotrophic metabarcodes represented by 89,951,866 sequences and belonging to 133 taxonomic lineages were identified and classified into four mixotrophic functional types: constitutive mixotrophs (CM), generalist non-constitutive mixotrophs (GNCM), endo-symbiotic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (eSNCM), and plastidic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (pSNCM). Mixotrophy appeared ubiquitous, and the distributions of the four mixotypes were analyzed to identify the abiotic factors shaping their biogeographies. Kleptoplastidic mixotrophs (GNCM and pSNCM) were detected in new zones compared to previous morphological studies. Constitutive and non-constitutive mixotrophs had similar ranges of distributions. Most lineages were evenly found in the samples, yet some of them displayed strongly contrasted distributions, both across and within mixotypes. Particularly divergent biogeographies were found within endo-symbiotic mixotrophs, depending on the ability to form colonies or the mode of symbiosis. We showed how metabarcoding can be used in a complementary way with previous morphological observations to study the biogeography of mixotrophic protists and to identify key drivers of their biogeography.

publication_nr_2_pubmed_abstract	Diatoms are a diverse and ecologically important group of phytoplankton. Although most species are considered free living, several are known to interact with other organisms within the plankton. Detailed imaging and molecular characterization of any such partnership is, however, limited, and an appraisal of the large-scale distribution and ecology of such consortia was never attempted. Here, observation of Tara Oceans samples from the Benguela Current led to the detection of an epibiotic association between a pennate diatom and a tintinnid ciliate. We identified the diatom as Fragilariopsis doliolus that possesses a unique feature to form barrel-shaped chains, associated with seven different genera of tintinnids including five previously undescribed associations. The organisms were commonly found together in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins, and live observations of the interaction have been recorded for the first time. By combining confocal and scanning electron microscopy of individual consortia with the sequencing of high-resolution molecular markers, we analyzed their distribution in the global ocean, revealing morpho-genetically distinct tintinnid haplotypes and biogeographically structured diatom haplotypes. The diatom was among the most abundant in the global ocean. We show that the consortia were particularly prevalent in nutrient-replete conditions, rich in potential predators. These observations support the hypothesis of a mutualistic symbiosis, wherein diatoms acquire increased motility and tintinnids benefit from silicification through increased protection, and highlight that such associations may be more prevalent than currently appreciated.

publication_nr_3_pubmed_abstract	Collodaria are heterotrophic marine protists that exist either as large colonies composed of hundreds of cells or as large solitary cells. All described species so far harbour intracellular microalgae as photosymbionts. Although recent environmental diversity surveys based on molecular methods demonstrated their consistently high contribution to planktonic communities and their worldwide occurrence, our understanding of their diversity and biogeography is still very limited. Here we estimated the 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene copies per collodarian cell for solitary (5770+/-1960 small subunit (SSU) rDNA copies) and colonial specimens (37 474+/-17 799 SSU rDNA copies, for each individual cell within a colony) using single-specimen quantitative PCR. We then investigated the environmental diversity of Collodaria within the photic zone through the metabarcoding survey from the Tara Oceans expedition and found that the two collodarian families Collosphaeridae and Sphaerozoidae contributed the most to the collodarian diversity and encompassed mostly cosmopolitan taxa. Although the biogeographical patterns were homogeneous within each biogeochemical biome considered, we observed that coastal biomes were consistently less diverse than oceanic biomes and were dominated by the Sphaerozoidae while the Collosphaeridae were dominant in the open oceans. The significant relationships with six environmental variables suggest that collodarian diversity is influenced by the trophic status of oceanic provinces and increased towards more oligotrophic regions.

publication_nr_4_pubmed_abstract	The biological carbon pump is the process by which CO2 is transformed to organic carbon via photosynthesis, exported through sinking particles, and finally sequestered in the deep ocean. While the intensity of the pump correlates with plankton community composition, the underlying ecosystem structure driving the process remains largely uncharacterized. Here we use environmental and metagenomic data gathered during the Tara Oceans expedition to improve our understanding of carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean. We show that specific plankton communities, from the surface and deep chlorophyll maximum, correlate with carbon export at 150 m and highlight unexpected taxa such as Radiolaria and alveolate parasites, as well as Synechococcus and their phages, as lineages most strongly associated with carbon export in the subtropical, nutrient-depleted, oligotrophic ocean. Additionally, we show that the relative abundance of a few bacterial and viral genes can predict a significant fraction of the variability in carbon export in these regions.
