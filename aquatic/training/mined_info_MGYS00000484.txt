study_name	Marine metagenomes from 3 sediment samples along a pH gradient in Papua New Guinea
study_abstract	Sediment microbial communities are key players in biogeochemical cycling and the remineralization of organic matter on tropical reefs. To better understand the long-term effects of low pH conditions on sediment microbial communities, microbial diversity and community composition were investigated at naturally CO2-rich tropical coral reefs in Papua New Guinea. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses will reveal insights into the response of sediment microbial communities and their functions to low pH environments.
