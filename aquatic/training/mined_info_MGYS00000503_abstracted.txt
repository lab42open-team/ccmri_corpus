study_abstract	Hydrothermal vent systems provide access points to the extensive microbial communities of the rocky subseafloor. These subseafloor communities have the potential to influence ocean biogeochemistry and, in particular, the chemolithoautotrophic populations could potentially provide a large amount of new production to the deep sea. In this study, we used RNA-based stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP) metatranscriptomics to identify the active autotrophic players and genomic pathways present in venting fluids from Axial Seamount, a submarine volcano off the coast of Oregon, USA. Vent fluids for RNA-SIP were collected from a singular vent, Marker 113, and used in shipboard incubations with 13C labeled sodium bicarbonate at 30, 55, and 80?C. Results from RNA-SIP incubations show enrichment of RNA at all three temperatures after 18-36 hours, indicating the presence and activity of subseafloor chemolithoautotrophic microbes in vent fluids. In RNA-SIP experiments across a range of temperatures, both taxonomic and functional diversity was reduced compared to un-manipulated diffuse fluids. At 30?C and 55?C, Epsilonproteobacteria were dominant, oxidizing hydrogen and primarily reducing nitrate. Methanogenic archaea were also present at 55?C, and were the only autotrophs present at 80?C. Correspondingly, the predominant CO2 fixation pathways changed from the reductive TCA cycle to the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway with increasing temperature. This study demonstrates the presence of an active autotrophic subseafloor community across geothermal gradients, lending insight into chemolithoautotrophic communities in the subseafloor at deep-sea hydrothermal vents

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The chemolithoautotrophic microbial community of the rocky subseafloor potentially provides a large amount of organic carbon to the deep ocean, yet our understanding of the activity and metabolic complexity of subseafloor organisms remains poorly described. A combination of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and RNA stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP) analyses were used to identify the metabolic potential, expression patterns, and active autotrophic bacteria and archaea and their pathways present in low-temperature hydrothermal fluids from Axial Seamount, an active submarine volcano. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic results showed the presence of genes and transcripts for sulfur, hydrogen, and ammonium oxidation, oxygen respiration, denitrification, and methanogenesis, as well as multiple carbon fixation pathways. In RNA-SIP experiments across a range of temperatures under reducing conditions, the enriched (13)C fractions showed differences in taxonomic and functional diversity. At 30 C and 55 C, Epsilonproteobacteria were dominant, oxidizing hydrogen and primarily reducing nitrate. Methanogenic archaea were also present at 55 C, and were the only autotrophs present at 80 C. Correspondingly, the predominant CO2 fixation pathways changed from the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle to the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway with increasing temperature. By coupling RNA-SIP with meta-omics, this study demonstrates the presence and activity of distinct chemolithoautotrophic communities across a thermal gradient of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent.
