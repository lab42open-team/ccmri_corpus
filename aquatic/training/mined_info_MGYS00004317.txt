study_name	Depth dependent (0-5,000 m) and seasonal variability in archaeal community structure in the subarctic and subtropical western North Pacific.
study_abstract	Archaeal community composition was examined throughout the water column (0-5,000 m) of the subtropical and subarctic western North Pacific Ocean using a pyrosequencing-based analysis of archaeal 16S rRNA gene. Samples were collected on four occasions between 2011 and 2012 to explore seasonal variability in the community composition.
