study_name	Amazon Continuum Metagenomes
study_abstract	This project focuses on the Amazon River-to-tropical Atlantic Ocean continuum because of both its immense scale and its apparent sensitivity to climate variability and anthropogenic forcing. The river's effect on the ocean depends not only on the river hydrology, but what the river carries and how those components are modified during transit from their terrestrial or aquatic origins. We brought together limnologists and oceanographers in an integrated project to improve our understanding of carbon exchange between the atmosphere and this tropical river continuum, focusing on the lower reach, nearshore, and offshore tropical Atlantic, with the goal of improving predictive capabilities under differing climate change scenarios.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Melanized fungi and black yeasts in the family Herpotrichiellaceae (order Chaetothyriales) are important agents of human and animal infectious diseases such as chromoblastomycosis and phaeohyphomycosis. The oligotrophic nature of these fungi enables them to survive in adverse environments where common saprobes are absent. Due to their slow growth, they lose competition with common saprobes, and therefore isolation studies yielded low frequencies of clinically relevant species in environmental habitats from which humans are thought to be infected. This problem can be solved with metagenomic techniques which allow recognition of microorganisms independent from culture. The present study aimed to identify species of the family Herpotrichiellaceae that are known to occur in Brazil by the use of molecular markers to screen public environmental metagenomic datasets from Brazil available in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Species characterization was performed with the BLAST comparison of previously described barcodes and padlock probe sequences. A total of 18,329 sequences was collected comprising the genera Cladophialophora, Exophiala, Fonsecaea, Rhinocladiella and Veronaea, with a focus on species related to the chromoblastomycosis. The data obtained in this study demonstrated presence of these opportunists in the investigated datasets. The used techniques contribute to our understanding of environmental occurrence and epidemiology of black fungi.
