study_name	Metagenomic study of the eukaryotic microorganisms diversity of a pond based on an environmental DNA (eDNA) sample.
study_abstract	Usually, to determine the biological quality of a body of water, micro fauna and especially macroinvertebrates are determined using a binocular microscope. This study aims to compare this traditional method of species census with the analysis by metagenomic of environmental DNA (eDNA) from the same pond sample.
