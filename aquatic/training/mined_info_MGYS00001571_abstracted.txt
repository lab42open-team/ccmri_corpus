study_name	Growth of heterotrophic aquatic bacteria in winter is controlled by organic matter availability rather than temperature
study_abstract	In winter 2009/10, a sudden under-ice bloom of heterotrophic bacteria occurred in the seasonally ice-covered, temperate, deep, oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (NE Germany). Extraordinary high bacterial abundance and biomass were fueled by the breakdown of a massive bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. The ice-cover was blanketed by snow leading to a significant reduction of the incident light. This exerted a pronounced physiological stress on the cyanobacteria. These were rapidly colonized by heterotrophic bacteria resulting in a sudden proliferation of associated and subsequently of free-living bacteria. Total bacterial protein production reached 201 ?g C l-1 d-1 - ca. five times higher than previously measured values that year. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis at high temporal resolution showed a sharp change in bacterial community structure coinciding with changes in cyanobacteria physiology. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that during cyanobacteria breakdown diversity of cyanobacteria-associated and free-living bacteria communities were reduced to a few dominant families. Some of these families were not detectable during the early stages of the cyanobacterial bloom indicating that senescent cells of cyanobacteria select for specific and well adapted bacterial communities. This massive bacterial bloom was rapidly terminated by heterotrophic nanoflagellates shortly before ice-off. Our case study suggests that in winter, unlike commonly postulated, carbon rather than temperature is the limiting factor for bacterial growth. This highlights the need for year-round studies of aquatic ecosystems including the winter season to correctly understand and model element and energy cycling through aquatic food webs, particularly the microbial loop.

Extraordinarily high bacterial abundance and biomass were fueled by the breakdown of a massive bloom of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae after ice formation. A reduction in light resulting from snow coverage exerted a pronounced physiological stress on the cyanobacteria. Consequently, these were rapidly colonized, leading to a sudden proliferation of attached and subsequently of free-living heterotrophic bacteria. Total bacterial protein production reached 201 myg C L(-1) d(-1), ca. five times higher than spring-peak values that year. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis at high temporal resolution showed pronounced changes in bacterial community structure coinciding with changes in the physiology of the cyanobacteria. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that during breakdown of the cyanobacterial population, the diversity of attached and free-living bacterial communities were reduced to a few dominant families. Some of these were not detectable during the early stages of the cyanobacterial bloom indicating that only specific, well adapted bacterial communities can colonize senescent cyanobacteria. Our study suggests that in winter, unlike commonly postulated, carbon rather than temperature is the limiting factor for bacterial growth. Frequent phytoplankton blooms in ice-covered systems highlight the need for year-round studies of aquatic ecosystems including the winter season to correctly understand element and energy cycling through aquatic food webs, particularly the microbial loop. On a global scale, such knowledge is required to determine climate change induced alterations in carbon budgets in polar and temperate aquatic systems.
