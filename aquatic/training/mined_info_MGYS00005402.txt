study_name	Deterministic microbial communities dynamics in salterns exposed to different light intensities
study_abstract	Microbial communities thriving in salterns are influenced by high salinity and high light irradiation. Here, short read metagenomes (Illumina) were sequenced from 3 different ponds. One was applied as control with no environmental stress applied. The other pond was covered with a plastic mess decreasing the environmental light intensity.
