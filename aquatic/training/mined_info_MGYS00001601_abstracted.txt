study_name	Assessing the groundwater quality at a Saudi Arabian agricultural site and the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant opportunistic pathogens on irrigated food produce
study_abstract	This study monitors the groundwater in wells situated near to agricultural fields of Saudi Arabia. Vegetables irrigated with the groundwater were also assessed for their microbial safety. The amount of total nitrogen exceeded the 15 mg/L permissible for agricultural irrigation in most of the sampled groundwater. Fecal coliforms in density >12 MPN/100 mL were detected in some of the groundwater wells of close proximity to a chicken farm. Coupled with qPCR-based fecal source tracking, monitoring effort showed that groundwater in two of the wells nearest to the chicken farm were relatively more perturbed than the other wells. Anthropogenic contamination resulted in a shift of predominant bacterial phylum within the groundwater microbial communities. Specifically, there was an elevated presence of Proteobacteria but a lower microbial richness in the groundwater perturbed by anthropogenic contamination. Acinetobacter was detected at high relative abundance of up to 48.6% in the total microbial community of groundwater but culture-based analysis did not recover any antibiotic-resistant bacteria and opportunistic pathogens from the groundwater. Although Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the vegetables irrigated with the groundwater, quantitative microbial risk assessment suggests that the annual risk incurred from consumption of these vegetables are within the acceptable limits of 10-4. Our findings highlighted that the groundwater quality at this agricultural site in the western Saudi Arabia was not as pristine as commonly perceived. Despite the poor groundwater quality, there was no significant impairment of food quality arising from the groundwater.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	This study examines the groundwater quality in wells situated near agricultural fields in Saudi Arabia. Fruits (e.g., tomato and green pepper) irrigated with groundwater were also assessed for the occurrence of opportunistic pathogens to determine if food safety was compromised by the groundwater. The amount of total nitrogen in most of the groundwater samples exceeded the 15 mg/L permissible limit for agricultural irrigation. Fecal coliforms in densities &gt; 12 MPN/100 mL were detected in three of the groundwater wells that were in close proximity to a chicken farm. These findings, coupled with qPCR-based fecal source tracking, show that groundwater in wells D and E, which were nearest to the chicken farm, had compromised quality. Anthropogenic contamination resulted in a shift in the predominant bacterial phyla within the groundwater microbial communities. For example, there was an elevated presence of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria in wells D and E but a lower overall microbial richness in the groundwater perturbed by anthropogenic contamination. In the remaining wells, the genus Acinetobacter was detected at high relative abundance ranging from 1.5% to 48% of the total groundwater microbial community. However, culture-based analysis did not recover any antibiotic-resistant bacteria or opportunistic pathogens from these groundwater samples. In contrast, opportunistic pathogenic Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the fruits irrigated with the groundwater from wells B and F. Although the groundwater was compromised, quantitative microbial risk assessment suggests that the annual risk incurred from accidental consumption of E. faecalis on these fruits was within the acceptable limit of 10(-4). However, the annual risk arising from P. aeruginosa was 9.55 x 10(-4), slightly above the acceptable limit. Our findings highlight that the groundwater quality at this agricultural site in western Saudi Arabia is not pristine and that better agricultural management practices are needed alongside groundwater treatment strategies to improve food safety.
