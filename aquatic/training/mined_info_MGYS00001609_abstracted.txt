study_name	Metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from the diffuse hydrothermal vents of Axial Seamount from 2013
study_abstract	This projects explores the functional diversity and activity of rocky subseafloor microbial communities in hydrothermal vent systems. Samples were collected in 2013 from a number of low temperature diffuse fluid vents at Axial seamount, located in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were performed on four diffuse vent samples. Previous work at this site determined the taxonomic structure and distribution of microbial communities in venting fluids, but the contribution and mechanisms of the different redox driven metabolisms and the impact these reactions have on vent chemical signatures have not been fully characterized. This study helps to determine the genetic potential and expression patterns of the largely uncharacterized subseafloor microbial community and shows how these patterns change across the complicated biogeochemical gradients of hydrothermal vent systems.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	In the ocean, viruses impact microbial mortality, regulate biogeochemical cycling, and alter the metabolic potential of microbial lineages. At deep-sea hydrothermal vents, abundant viruses infect a wide range of hosts among the archaea and bacteria that inhabit these dynamic habitats. However, little is known about viral diversity, host range, and biogeography across different vent ecosystems, which has important implications for how viruses manipulate microbial function and evolution. Here, we examined viral diversity, viral and host distribution, and virus-host interactions in microbial metagenomes generated from venting fluids from several vent sites within three different geochemically and geographically distinct hydrothermal systems: Piccard and Von Damm vent fields at the Mid-Cayman Rise in the Caribbean Sea, and at several vent sites within Axial Seamount in the Pacific Ocean. Analysis of viral sequences and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) spacers revealed highly diverse viral assemblages and evidence of active infection. Network analysis revealed that viral host range was relatively narrow, with very few viruses infecting multiple microbial lineages. Viruses were largely endemic to individual vent sites, indicating restricted dispersal, and in some cases, viral assemblages persisted over time. Thus, we show that hydrothermal vent fluids are home to novel, diverse viral assemblages that are highly localized to specific regions and taxa. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Viruses play important roles in manipulating microbial communities and their evolution in the ocean, yet not much is known about viruses in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. However, viral ecology and evolution are of particular interest in hydrothermal vent habitats because of their unique nature: previous studies have indicated that most viruses in hydrothermal vents are temperate rather than lytic, and it has been established that rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are particularly high among thermophilic vent microbes, and viruses are common vectors for HGT. If viruses have broad host range or are widespread across vent sites, they have increased potential to act as gene-sharing "highways" between vent sites. By examining viral diversity, distribution, and infection networks across disparate vent sites, this study provides the opportunity to better characterize and constrain the viral impact on hydrothermal vent microbial communities. We show that viruses in hydrothermal vents are diverse and apparently active, but most have restricted host range and are not widely distributed among vent sites. Thus, the impacts of viral infection are likely to be highly localized and constrained to specific taxa in these habitats.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Microbial genomes have highly variable gene content, and the evolutionary history of microbial populations is shaped by gene gain and loss mediated by horizontal gene transfer and selection. To evaluate the influence of selection on gene content variation in hydrothermal vent microbial populations, we examined 22 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) (70 to 97% complete) from the ubiquitous vent Epsilonbacteraeota genus <i>Sulfurovum</i> that were recovered from two deep-sea hydrothermal vent regions, Axial Seamount in the northeastern Pacific Ocean (13 MAGs) and the Mid-Cayman Rise in the Caribbean Sea (9 MAGs). Genes involved in housekeeping functions were highly conserved across <i>Sulfurovum</i> lineages. However, genes involved in environment-specific functions, and in particular phosphate regulation, were found mostly in <i>Sulfurovum</i> genomes from the Mid-Cayman Rise in the low-phosphate Atlantic Ocean environment, suggesting that nutrient limitation is an important selective pressure for these bacteria. Furthermore, genes that were rare within the pangenome were more likely to undergo positive selection than genes that were highly conserved in the pangenome, and they also appeared to have experienced gene-specific sweeps. Our results suggest that selection is a significant driver of gene gain and loss for dominant microbial lineages in hydrothermal vents and highlight the importance of factors like nutrient limitation in driving microbial adaptation and evolution.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Microbes can alter their gene content through the gain and loss of genes. However, there is some debate as to whether natural selection or neutral processes play a stronger role in molding the gene content of microbial genomes. In this study, we examined variation in gene content for the Epsilonbacteraeota genus <i>Sulfurovum</i> from deep-sea hydrothermal vents, which are dynamic habitats known for extensive horizontal gene transfer within microbial populations. Our results show that natural selection is a strong driver of <i>Sulfurovum</i> gene content and that nutrient limitation in particular has shaped the <i>Sulfurovum</i> genome, leading to differences in gene content between ocean basins. Our results also suggest that recently acquired genes undergo stronger selection than genes that were acquired in the more distant past. Overall, our results highlight the importance of natural selection in driving the evolution of microbial populations in these dynamic habitats.
