publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Wetlands constitute the main natural source of methane on Earth due to their high content of natural organic matter (NOM), but key drivers, such as electron acceptors, supporting methanotrophic activities in these habitats are poorly understood. We performed anoxic incubations using freshly collected sediment, along with water samples harvested from a tropical wetland, amended with <sup>13</sup>C-methane (0.67 atm) to test the capacity of its microbial community to perform anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) linked to the reduction of the humic fraction of its NOM. Collected evidence demonstrates that electron-accepting functional groups (e.g., quinones) present in NOM fueled AOM by serving as a terminal electron acceptor. Indeed, while sulfate reduction was the predominant process, accounting for up to 42.5% of the AOM activities, the microbial reduction of NOM concomitantly occurred. Furthermore, enrichment of wetland sediment with external NOM provided a complementary electron-accepting capacity, of which reduction accounted for ~100 nmol <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub> oxidized * cm<sup>-3</sup> * day<sup>-1</sup> Spectroscopic evidence showed that quinone moieties were heterogeneously distributed in the wetland sediment, and their reduction occurred during the course of AOM. Moreover, an enrichment derived from wetland sediments performing AOM linked to NOM reduction stoichiometrically oxidized methane coupled to the reduction of the humic analogue anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate. Microbial populations potentially involved in AOM coupled to microbial reduction of NOM were dominated by divergent biota from putative AOM-associated archaea. We estimate that this microbial process potentially contributes to the suppression of up to 114 teragrams (Tg) of CH<sub>4</sub> * year<sup>-1</sup> in coastal wetlands and more than 1,300 Tg * year<sup>-1</sup>, considering the global wetland area.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The identification of key processes governing methane emissions from natural systems is of major importance considering the global warming effects triggered by this greenhouse gas. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to the microbial reduction of distinct electron acceptors plays a pivotal role in mitigating methane emissions from ecosystems. Given their high organic content, wetlands constitute the largest natural source of atmospheric methane. Nevertheless, processes controlling methane emissions in these environments are poorly understood. Here, we provide tracer analysis with <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub> and spectroscopic evidence revealing that AOM linked to the microbial reduction of redox functional groups in natural organic matter (NOM) prevails in a tropical wetland. We suggest that microbial reduction of NOM may largely contribute to the suppression of methane emissions from tropical wetlands. This is a novel avenue within the carbon cycle in which slowly decaying NOM (e.g., humic fraction) in organotrophic environments fuels AOM by serving as a terminal electron acceptor.
