publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	In this work, they compared patterns of abundant and rare picoeukaryotic sub-communities in the epipelagic waters (surface and 40-75 m depth subsurface layers) of the East and South China Seas across seasons via 454 pyrosequencing of the V4 region of 18S rDNA. They also examined the relative effects of environmental filtering, dispersal limitations and seasonality on community assembly. Their results indicated that (i) in the surface layer, abundant taxa are primarily influenced by dispersal limitations and rare taxa are primarily influenced by environmental filtering, whereas (ii) in the subsurface layer, both abundant and rare sub-communities are only weakly influenced by environmental filtering but are strongly influenced by dispersal limitations. Moreover, (iii) abundant taxa exhibit stronger temporal variability than rare taxa. They also found that abundant and rare sub-communities display similar spatial richness patterns that are negatively correlated with latitude and chlorophyll a and positively correlated with temperature. In summary, environmental filtering and dispersal limitations have different effects on abundant and rare picoeukaryotic sub-communities in different layers. Thus, depth appears as an essential variable that governs the structuring patterns of picoeukaryotic communities in the oceans and should be thoroughly considered to develop a more comprehensive understanding of oceanic microbial assemblages.
