study_abstract	The central Arctic Ocean has been covered by heavy sea ice, thus the condition of the underlying ecosystem has remained uncertain. To investigate the microbial eukaryotes diversity in seawater from the central Arctic Ocean, water samples were collected from five stations during the 3rd Chinese Arctic Scientific Expedition in 2008. After pyrosequencing with a 454 Life Science GS-FLX sequencer, the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene sequences were analysis, the molecular diversity of microbial eukaryotes of sea water from the central Arctic Ocean was generally achieved.
