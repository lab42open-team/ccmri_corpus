study_name	Metagenome data from DNA stable isotope probing of Stiffkey saltmarsh sediment microcosms to investigate methanogenesis from choline
study_abstract	Coastal saltmarsh sediments represent an important source of natural methane emissions, much of the methanogenesis originates from quaternary and methylated amines, such as choline and trimethylamine. However, the key microbes involved in choline-dependent methanogenesis remain poorly characterized and the metabolic pathways by which the saltmarsh microbes degrade choline and form methane are yet to be determined. In this study, we combined DNA stable isotope probing microcosms with high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and 13C2-choline enriched metagenomes, followed by binning of the microbial population genomes to identify the microbes responsible for methanogenesis. Microcosm incubation with 13C2-choline leads to the formation of trimethylamine and subsequent methane production, suggesting that choline-dependent methanogenesis is a two-step process involving trimethylamine as the key intermediate. Amplicon sequencing analysis identified Deltaproteobacteria, of the genera Pelobacter and Desulfuromonas were the major choline-utilizers. The methanogenic Archaea, of the genera Methanococcoides became enriched in choline-amended microcosms, indicating their role in methane formation from trimethylamine. The binning of the microbial population genomes from metagenomic DNA resulted in the identification of bins that are classified as Pelobacter, Desulfuromonas, Methanococcoides and their associated viruses. Analyses of these bins revealed that Pelobacter and Desulfuromonas have the genetic potential to degrade choline to trimethylamine using the choline-trimethylamine lyase pathway, whereas Methanococcoides are capable of methanogenesis using the pyrrolysine-containing trimethylamine methyltransferase pathway.
