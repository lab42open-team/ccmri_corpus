study_abstract	In this study, we investigated marine sediment from around the Okinawan 'Kaichu-Doro' Causeway, which was constructed 44 years ago to connect three islands (Henza-jima, Miyagi-jima, Hamahiga-jima) to Okinawa. The construction of this causeway has been shown to influence the surrounding marine ecosystem via fragmentation and the loss of water circulation. In this research, we collected 10 sediment cores (5 cores from each side) 60-80 cm length from 1 m water depth and divided into layers (each layer 15 cm) to examine differences in environmental DNA from areas around the causeway. We examined the vertical diversity of microbial communities and metabolite to elucidate and estimate the correlation between metabolites and microbial communities among marine sediment layers.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Microbial community diversity and chemodiversity were investigated in marine sediments adjacent to the Okinawan "Kaichu-Doro" Causeway, which was constructed 46 years ago to connect a group of four islands (Henza-jima, Miyagi-jima, Ikei-jima, Hamahiga-jima) to the Okinawan main island. This causeway was not built on pilings, but by land reclamation; hence, it now acts as a long, thin peninsula. The construction of this causeway was previously shown to have influenced the surrounding marine ecosystem, causing ecosystem fragmentation and loss of water circulation. In this study, we collected sediment cores (<i>n</i> = 10) from five paired sites in 1 m water depths. Each pair of sites consisted of one site each on the immediate north and south sides of the causeway. Originally the members of each pair were much closer to each other (&lt;150 m) than to other pairs, but now the members of each pair are isolated by the causeway. Each core was 60-80 cm long and was divided into 15-cm layers. We examined the vertical diversity of microbial communities and chemical compounds to determine the correlation between chemodiversity and microbial communities among marine sediment cores and layers. Principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) of detected compounds and of bacterial and archaeal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) revealed that the north and south sides of the causeway are relatively isolated, with each side having unique microbial OTUs. Additionally, some bacterial families (e.g., Acidaminobacteraceae, Rhizobiaceae, and Xanthomonadaceae) were found only on the south side of Kaichu-Doro. Interestingly, we found that the relative abundance of OTUs for some microbial families increased from top to bottom, but this was reversed in some other families. We conclude that the causeway has altered microbial community composition and metabolite profiles in marine sediments.
