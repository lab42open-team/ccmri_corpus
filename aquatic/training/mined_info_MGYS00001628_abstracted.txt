study_name	Microbial Community in High Arsenic Shallow Aquifers in Hetao Basin of Inner Mongolia, China by 454 Pyrosequencing
study_abstract	A comprehensive survey of microbial community with 454 Pyrosequencing was carried out in 20 groundwater samples (4 low and 16 high arsenic groundwater) and 19 sediments from three boreholes (two high arsenic boreholes and one low arsenic borehole) in a high arsenic groundwater system located in Hetao Basin, Inner Mongolia by. A total of 233,704 reads and 12-267 species-level OTUs were detected. Richness and diversity of microbial communities in high arsenic sediments are higher than those in high arsenic groundwater. Microbial community structure was significantly different either between low arsenic and high arsenic samples or between groundwater and sediments. Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Psychrobacter and Alishewanella were the top four predominant populations in high arsenic groundwater, while Thiobacillus, Pseudomonas, Hydrogenophaga, Enterobacteriaceae, Sulfuricurvum and Arthrobacter were distinctly dominated in high arsenic sediments. Acinetobacter was distinctly dominated in groundwater with the markedly high relative abundance (average 62.41%), and Thiobacillus was significantly abundant (average abundance 24.62%) in sediments. Archaeal sequences of high arsenic groundwater were mostly related to methanogens. Groundwater and sediment samples were divided into low and high arsenic groups based on geochemical parameters and microbial communities by hierarchical clustering and PCoA analyses. This suggested that arsenic is a critical environmental factor that contributes to the difference microbial community structure. BIO-ENV and co-inertia analyses showed that some other geochemical parameters including TOC, SO42-, SO42-/TS and Fe2+ were also the important factors causing the difference of the microbial community. The results of this study expand our current understanding of microbial ecology in high arsenic aquifers and emphasize the potential importance of microbes in arsenic mobilization in the shallow aquifers of Hetao Basin, Inner Mongolia.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	A survey was carried out on the microbial community of 20 groundwater samples (4 low and 16 high arsenic groundwater) and 19 sediments from three boreholes (two high arsenic and one low arsenic boreholes) in a high arsenic groundwater system located in Hetao Basin, Inner Mongolia, using the 454 pyrosequencing approach. A total of 233,704 sequence reads were obtained and classified into 12-267 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Groundwater and sediment samples were divided into low and high arsenic groups based on measured geochemical parameters and microbial communities, by hierarchical clustering and principal coordinates analysis. Richness and diversity of the microbial communities in high arsenic sediments are higher than those in high arsenic groundwater. Microbial community structure was significantly different either between low and high arsenic samples or between groundwater and sediments. Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Psychrobacter and Alishewanella were the top four genera in high arsenic groundwater, while Thiobacillus, Pseudomonas, Hydrogenophaga, Enterobacteriaceae, Sulfuricurvum and Arthrobacter dominated high arsenic sediments. Archaeal sequences in high arsenic groundwater were mostly related to methanogens. Biota-environment matching and co-inertia analyses showed that arsenic, total organic carbon, SO4(2-), SO4(2-)/total sulfur ratio, and Fe(2+) were important environmental factors shaping the observed microbial communities. The results of this study expand our current understanding of microbial ecology in high arsenic groundwater aquifers and emphasize the potential importance of microbes in arsenic transformation in the Hetao Basin, Inner Mongolia.
