study_abstract	Abyssal sediments, polymetallic nodules, and water-column samples were collected from the UKSRL1, OMS claim area as well as APEI within the Clarion-Clipperton fracture zone in the Pacific Ocean. The ABYSSLINE 2015 Cruise took place aboard the research vessel Thomas G. Thompson (R/V Thompson) between February 12, 2015 and March 25, 2015, as an expedition jointly funded and supported by Seabed Resources Limited and Ocean Mineral Singapore. The chief objective of the AB02 was to conduct an evaluation of biological and environmental baseline conditions in the UK-1 contract area, and the OMS contract area at depths ranging from 3900 to 4400 meters (m) in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ; also known as the Clarion Clipperton Fracture Zone). Specifically, the study targeted two 30 by 30 kilometer (km) areas; one in the UK-1 contract area and one in the OMS contract area, centered approximately at 13 degrees 49 minutes North, 116 degrees 36 minutes West (13 49' N, 116 36' W) and 13 degrees 49 minutes North, 116 degrees 36 minutes West (13 49' N, 116 36' W), respectively. This project consists of samples isolated at the sediment sites described above and inoculated into seawater medium in microcosm experiments to evaluate the influence of bicarbonate on community composition.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Marine bacteria regulate fluxes of matter and energy essential for pelagic and benthic organisms and may also be involved in the formation and maintenance of commercially valuable abyssal polymetallic nodules. Future mining of these nodule fields is predicted to have substantial effects on biodiversity and physicochemical conditions in mined areas. Yet, the identity and distributions of bacterial populations in deep-sea sediments and associated polymetallic nodules has received relatively little attention. We examined bacterial communities using high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments from samples collected in the water column, sediment, and polymetallic nodules in the Pacific Ocean (bottom depth >=4,000 m) in the eastern Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs; defined at 99% 16S rRNA gene identity) affiliated with JTB255 (Gammaproteobacteria) and <i>Rhodospirillaceae</i> (Alphaproteobacteria) had higher relative abundances in the nodule and sediment habitats compared to the water column. <i>Rhodobiaceae</i> family and <i>Vibrio</i> OTUs had higher relative abundance in nodule samples, but were less abundant in sediment and water column samples. Bacterial communities in sediments and associated with nodules were generally similar; however, 5,861 and 6,827 OTUs found in the water column were retrieved from sediment and nodule habitats, respectively. Cyanobacterial OTUs clustering among <i>Prochlorococcus</i> and <i>Synechococcus</i> were detected in both sediments and nodules, with greater representation among nodule samples. Such results suggest that vertical export of typically abundant photic-zone microbes may be an important process in delivery of water column microorganisms to abyssal habitats, potentially influencing the structure and function of communities in polymetallic nodule fields.
