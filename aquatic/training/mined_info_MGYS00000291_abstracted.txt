study_name	Viral metagenomic study of two freshwater Lakes
study_abstract	Viruses are known to be the most abundant biological entities in aquatic environment, where they are (i) important top-down regulation factors for microbial communities, (ii) known to interfere in major biogeochemical cycles, and (iii) thought to be an important source of genetic diversity. Yet, diversity and distribution of these viruses is still far from being understood, especially in freshwater ecosystems. Metagenomic analysis of two different temperate freshwater viral communities showed that most of the viral sequences were not similar to those in the current databases. A deep sequencing (1.5 billion sequences) associated to a large read size (400 bp) allowed us to assess, for the first time, the diversity in the main viral families through direct phylogenetic analysis of specific marker genes. The analysis of the major viral groups found in the two lakes shed light on a great diversity, and retrieved previously unknown clades among single-stranded DNA viruses (Microviridae, Circoviridae, Nanoviridae) and among Caudovirales. The absence of lake-specific clade indicated that the new viruses identified were ubiquitous, at least on a regional freshwater lake scale. Compared to the previously published viromes, a significant genetic similarity between viral communities of related environments was highlighted for the first time, despite the great geographical distances separating these different communities. Thus, viruses appear to be distributed worldwide, and are likely selected by the presence or absence of their hosts. Gene richness analysis assessed through rarefaction curves showed an extraordinary genetic diversity of viruses in each of the two lakes under study. Such diversity was never retrieved previously, even in the last generation of published viromes. The global virome is thereby a fantastic pool of unknown genes, which remains partially sampled and understood.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Transitions between saline and fresh waters have been shown to be infrequent for microorganisms. Based on host-specific interactions, the presence of specific clades among hosts suggests the existence of freshwater-specific viral clades. Yet, little is known about the composition and diversity of the temperate freshwater viral communities, and even if freshwater lakes and marine waters harbor distinct clades for particular viral sub-families, this distinction remains to be demonstrated on a community scale.To help identify the characteristics and potential specificities of freshwater viral communities, such communities from two lakes differing by their ecological parameters were studied through metagenomics. Both the cluster richness and the species richness of the Lake Bourget virome were significantly higher that those of the Lake Pavin, highlighting a trend similar to the one observed for microorganisms (i.e. the specie richness observed in mesotrophic lakes is greater than the one observed in oligotrophic lakes). Using 29 previously published viromes, the cluster richness was shown to vary between different environment types and appeared significantly higher in marine ecosystems than in other biomes. Furthermore, significant genetic similarity between viral communities of related environments was highlighted as freshwater, marine and hypersaline environments were separated from each other despite the vast geographical distances between sample locations within each of these biomes. An automated phylogeny procedure was then applied to marker genes of the major families of single-stranded (Microviridae, Circoviridae, Nanoviridae) and double-stranded (Caudovirales) DNA viruses. These phylogenetic analyses all spotlighted a very broad diversity and previously unknown clades undetectable by PCR analysis, clades that gathered sequences from the two lakes. Thus, the two freshwater viromes appear closely related, despite the significant ecological differences between the two lakes. Furthermore, freshwater viral communities appear genetically distinct from other aquatic ecosystems, demonstrating the specificity of freshwater viruses at a community scale for the first time.
