study_abstract	Polyploid bacteria are more common than previously believed; however, little is known about the genetic and functional diversity incurred by having multiple chromosomes. We show, using the largest known freshwater bacterium, Achomatium sp., that single cells can host a genetic diversity equal to that of entire populations. No correlation was found between genetic diversity and functional role. The cells contain an excessive number of transposable elements and we hypothesize that these are involved in, intracellular, inter- and intra-chromosome gene re-arrangements; however, the integrity of operons is maintained. We further hypothesize that gene convergence is strongly reduced in these cells as suggested by the high diversity of the usually conserved 16S rRNA gene. Imaging the 16S rRNA distribution inside the cells points to the potentially spatial-differential expression of genes. Thus, intracellular gene transfer (iGT) leads to a large genetic diversity and potentially accelerated evolution. Polyploidy, multiple alleles, and localized gene expression, suggests Achromatium (and perhaps other polyploid bacteria) uses a genetic machinery similar to multicellular eukaryotes.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Polyploid bacteria are common, but the genetic and functional diversity resulting from polyploidy is unknown. Here we use single-cell genomics, metagenomics, single-cell amplicon sequencing, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, to show that individual cells of Achromatium oxaliferum, the world's biggest known freshwater bacterium, harbor genetic diversity typical of whole bacterial communities. The cells contain tens of transposable elements, which likely cause the unprecedented diversity that we observe in the sequence and synteny of genes. Given the high within-cell diversity of the usually conserved 16S ribosomal RNA gene, we suggest that gene conversion occurs in multiple, separated genomic hotspots. The ribosomal RNA distribution inside the cells hints to spatially differential gene expression. We also suggest that intracellular gene transfer may lead to extensive gene reshuffling and increased diversity.The cells of Achromatium bacteria are remarkably large and contain multiple chromosome copies. Here, Ionescu et al. show that chromosome copies within individual cells display high diversity, similar to that of bacterial communities, and contain tens of transposable elements.
