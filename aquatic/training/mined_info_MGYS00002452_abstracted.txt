study_name	Pelagic Microbiome: viruses to protists. 16S and 18S data from oceanic samples collected at the chlorophyll maximum.
study_abstract	We collected environmental samples during the second cruise of the project “The Great Southern Coccolithophore Belt” collecting samples in the South Indian Ocean and Southern Ocean; during the RSS James Clark Ross Cruise JCR271 as part of the project on Arctic Ocean Acidification collecting samples in the Arctic; finally we collected two costal samples off the coast of South Africa during algal bloom events. Samples included 16S, 18S amplicons and metagenomic data.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Microbes occupy diverse ecological niches and only through recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies have the true microbial diversity been revealed. Furthermore, lack of perceivable marine barriers to genetic dispersal (i.e., mountains or islands) has allowed the speculation that organisms that can be easily transported by currents and therefore proliferate everywhere. That said, ocean currents are now commonly being recognized as barriers for microbial dispersal. Here we analyzed samples collected from a total of six stations, four located in the Indian Ocean, and two in the Southern Ocean. Amplicon sequencing was used to characterize both prokaryotic and eukaryotic plankton communities, while shotgun sequencing was used for the combined environmental DNA (eDNA), microbial eDNA (meDNA), and viral fractions. We found that Cyanobacteria dominated the prokaryotic component in the South-West Indian Ocean, while Gamma-Proteobacteria dominated the South-East Indian Ocean. A combination of Gamma- and Alfa-Proteobacteria dominated the Southern Ocean. Alveolates dominated almost exclusively the eukaryotic component, with variation in the ratio of Protoalveolata and Dinoflagellata depending on station. However, an increase in haptophyte relative abundance was observed in the Southern Ocean. Similarly, the viral fraction was dominated by members of the order <i>Caudovirales</i> across all stations; however, a higher presence of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (mainly chloroviruses and mimiviruses) was observed in the Southern Ocean. To our knowledge, this is the first that a statistical difference in the microbiome (from viruses to protists) between the subtropical Indian and Southern Oceans. We also show that not all phylotypes can be found everywhere, and that meDNA is not a suitable resource for monitoring aquatic microbial diversity.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	The aquatic microbiome is composed of a multi-phylotype community of microbes, ranging from the numerically dominant viruses to the phylogenetically diverse unicellular phytoplankton. They influence key biogeochemical processes and form the base of marine food webs, becoming food for secondary consumers. Due to recent advances in next-generation sequencing, this previously overlooked component of our hydrosphere is starting to reveal its true diversity and biological complexity. We report here that 250 mL of seawater is sufficient to provide a comprehensive description of the microbial diversity in an oceanic environment. We found that there was a dominance of the order <i>Caudovirales</i> (59%), with the family <i>Myoviridae</i> being the most prevalent. The families <i>Phycodnaviridae</i> and <i>Mimiviridae</i> made up the remainder of pelagic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virome. Consistent with this analysis, the Cyanobacteria dominate (52%) the prokaryotic diversity. While the dinoflagellates and their endosymbionts, the superphylum Alveolata dominates (92%) the microbial eukaryotic diversity. A total of 834 prokaryotic, 346 eukaryotic and 254 unique virus phylotypes were recorded in this relatively small sample of water. We also provide evidence, through a metagenomic-barcoding comparative analysis, that viruses are the likely source of microbial environmental DNA (meDNA). This study opens the door to a more integrated approach to oceanographic sampling and data analysis.
