study_name	Metatranscriptomes from mesocosm experiments with added organic carbon (OM[ab] samples) and controls (C[ab] samples).
study_abstract	Microcosm experiments was done with water from the oxygen minimum zone (around 300-500 m depth) of the subtropical North Atlantic (latitude 17.71 , longitude -41.05) to study the response of mesopelagic prokaryotic communities to pulses of nutrients. Three different treatments and a control were established after prefiltering the seawater through 0.8 µm polycarbonate filters. Microcosms were amended either with thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), ammonium (NH4Cl) or pyruvate plus acetate (C3H3NaO3 and C2H3NaO3) and the control was not supplemented with any organic or inorganic compound. The treatments and the control were established in duplicate in 20 l carboys and held in the dark at in situ temperature for 110-140 h. At the end of the incubation the remaining water was collected through 0.22 µm polycarbonate filters for metatranscriptomic analysis

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	To decipher the response of mesopelagic prokaryotic communities to input of nutrients, we tracked changes in prokaryotic abundance, extracellular enzymatic activities, heterotrophic production, dark dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fixation, community composition (16S rRNA sequencing) and community gene expression (metatranscriptomics) in 3 microcosm experiments with water from the mesopelagic North Atlantic. Responses in 3 different treatments amended with thiosulfate, ammonium or organic matter (i.e., pyruvate plus acetate) were compared to unamended controls. The strongest stimulation was found in the organic matter enrichments, where all measured rates increased &gt;10-fold. Strikingly, in the organic matter treatment, the dark DIC fixation rates-assumed to be related to autotrophic metabolisms-were equally stimulated as all the other heterotrophic-related parameters. This increase in DIC fixation rates was paralleled by an up-regulation of genes involved in DIC assimilation via anaplerotic pathways. Alkaline phosphatase was the metabolic rate most strongly stimulated and its activity seemed to be related to cross-activation by nonpartner histidine kinases, and/or the activation of genes involved in the regulation of elemental balance during catabolic processes. These findings suggest that episodic events such as strong sedimentation of organic matter into the mesopelagic might trigger rapid increases of originally rare members of the prokaryotic community, enhancing heterotrophic and autotrophic carbon uptake rates, ultimately affecting carbon cycling. Our experiments highlight a number of fairly unstudied microbial processes of potential importance in mesopelagic waters that require future attention.
