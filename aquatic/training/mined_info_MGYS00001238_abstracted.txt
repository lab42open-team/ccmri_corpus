study_name	Biofilm sloughing in integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) systems
study_abstract	Biofilm sloughing is an integral aspect, and a dynamic activity of biofilm development. This study focused on biofilm sloughing on carriers in integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) systems in both laboratory (LS; synthetic feed) and full-scale (FS; municipal) systems. During biofilm development in the LS system the relative hydrophobicity of flocs and biofilm increased with an increase in carrier bound biomass. There was a decline in relative hydrophobicity of the flocs and attached biomass upon sloughing. The protein to polysaccharide ratio in the extracted EPS of the suspended biomass (flocs and sloughed biomass) and biofilms decreased and increased, respectively, which corresponds to confocal imaging showing that micro-colonies with polysaccharide rich content sloughing from the biofilms. Sloughed biomass rapidly associated with flocs to form large and compact structures that led to a decrease in SVI from 60-70 ml/L to 34 ml/L. The α and β diversities determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Illumina) of FS samples revealed greater diversity of the biofilm community compared to flocs. The α diversity of biofilms and suspended solids decreased and increased, respectively, during sloughing. The shift in community structure was in part due to the loss of Comamonadacae from the biofilm. At the class level, after biofilm sloughing, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, and Acidobacteria-6 dominated on the remaining biofilm. The relative abundance of Rhodocyclacae decreased in biofilms and flocs, after biofilm sloughing. Live-dead staining revealed areas of the biofilm where viability of biomass is an additional factor in sloughing.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Fate of biofilm sloughing was assessed in a laboratory-scale (LS) integrated fixed-film sequencing batch reactor (IF-SBR) treating synthetic wastewater and in a full-scale (FS) integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) system treating municipal wastewater. It was observed that the properties of biofilms and flocs, including sludge volume index (SVI), mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), effluent suspended solids (ESS), relative hydrophobicity, and composition of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) were associated with biofilm sloughing and formation of large granular flocs in the LS IF-SBR. In the FS IFAS system, the changes were studied at the molecular level. For example, the extracted EPS content results (the protein to polysaccharide ratio decreased in the flocs and increased in the biofilms, with biofilm sloughing) were complemented with the confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) coupled with molecular specific staining. CLSM analyses revealed that micro-colonies rich in polysaccharides readily sloughed from the carriers. Live-dead staining revealed areas of the biofilm where the viability of biomass was a contributing factor associated with areas of the biofilm susceptible to sloughing. 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Illumina) of FS IFAS samples revealed greater diversity (Alfa-diversity) in biofilms compared to flocs. Biofilm sloughing resulted in a decrease in diversity in biofilms and a corresponding increase in the flocs during sloughing. Microbial population dynamics revealed that bacteria known for denitrification (for example, Comamonadaceae) detached from the biofilms during sloughing, readily associated with the suspended biomass, and were retained in the bioreactors.
