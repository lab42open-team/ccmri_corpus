study_name	Microbial consortium enriched at the cathode of a solar microbial fuel cell
study_abstract	The objective of this project is to study a microbial biocathode consortium enriched at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory's Center for Bio/Molecular Science & Engineering. The initial inoculum for the solar microbial fuel cell was seawater collected near Rutgers, NJ, and the community has subsequently been maintained electroautotrophically via serial transfers on cathodes poised at 310 mV vs. SHE. This microbial consortium contains autotrophic organisms which can use a cathode as an electron donor and O2 as an electron acceptor, and has electrochemical properties potentially useful in bioenergy applications including microbial electrosynthesis and microbial fuel cell technology. System biology approaches will be used to identify functional genes that are relevant for bioenergy production, such as fixing CO2 as sole carbon source, electrosynthesis, O2 tolerance, etc. Several heterotrophic constituents have been isolated in pure culture, and have been sequenced by either Illumina or PacBio technologies. Furthermore, closed genomes and methylation data were obtained from PacBio sequencing of metagenomic DNA. Metagenomic libraries generated from eight biological replicates of an enriched biocathode microbial community were sequenced at 2x100 base pairs (bp) (paired-end reads) using an Illumina HiSeq 2000. The reads were assembled using either IDBAUD or Ray. The ideal k-mer length and node coverage were selected based on which gave results most similar to de novo sequencing of isolated bacterial cultures from the enriched community (Marinobacter sp. strain CP1 and Labrenzia sp. strain CP4). Metatranscriptomic libraries were generated from four reactors inoculated with the same inoculum were grown at a set potential of 310 mV SHE until current density stabilized, cyclic voltammetry was recorded, and then two of them were set at a more positive potential (470 mV) and two remained at 310 mV for 48 hours before samples were harvested for RNA extraction. This experiment was repeated with four more reactors inoculated with a new cell suspension from the same source electrode for a total of four biological replicates at each potential.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Biocathode microbial communities are proposed to catalyse a range of useful reactions. Unlike bioanodes, model biocathode organisms have not yet been successfully cultivated in isolation highlighting the need for culture-independent approaches to characterization. Biocathode MCL (Marinobacter, Chromatiaceae, Labrenzia) is a microbial community proposed to couple CO<sub>2</sub> fixation to extracellular electron transfer and O<sub>2</sub> reduction. Previous metagenomic analysis of a single MCL bioelectrochemical system (BES) resulted in resolution of 16 bin genomes. To further resolve bin genomes and compare community composition across replicate MCL BES, we performed shotgun metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene (16S) sequencing at steady-state current. Clustering pooled reads from replicate BES increased the number of resolved bin genomes to 20, over half of which were &gt; 90% complete. Direct comparison of unassembled metagenomic reads and 16S operational taxonomic units (OTUs) predicted higher community diversity than the assembled/clustered metagenome and the predicted relative abundances did not match. However, when 16S OTUs were mapped to bin genomes and genome abundance was scaled by 16S gene copy number, estimated relative abundance was more similar to metagenomic analysis. The relative abundance of the bin genome representing 'Ca. Tenderia electrophaga' was correlated with increasing current, further supporting the hypothesis that this organism is the electroautotroph.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Biocathodes provide a stable electron source to drive reduction reactions in electrotrophic microbial electrochemical systems. Electroautotrophic biocathode communities may be more robust than monocultures in environmentally relevant settings, but some members are not easily cultivated outside the electrode environment. We previously used metagenomics and metaproteomics to propose a pathway for coupling extracellular electron transfer (EET) to carbon fixation in "<i>Candidatus</i> Tenderia electrophaga," an uncultivated but dominant member of an electroautotrophic biocathode community. Here we validate and refine this proposed pathway using metatranscriptomics of replicate aerobic biocathodes poised at the growth potential level of 310 mV and the suboptimal 470 mV (versus the standard hydrogen electrode). At both potentials, transcripts were more abundant from "<i>Ca.</i> Tenderia electrophaga" than from any other constituent, and its relative activity was positively correlated with current. Several genes encoding key components of the proposed "<i>Ca.</i> Tenderia electrophaga" EET pathway were more highly expressed at 470 mV, consistent with a need for cells to acquire more electrons to obtain the same amount of energy as at 310 mV. These included <i>cyc2</i>, encoding a homolog of a protein known to be involved in iron oxidation. Mean expression of all CO<sub>2</sub> fixation-related genes is 0.27 log<sub>2</sub>-fold higher at 310 mV, indicating that reduced energy availability at 470 mV decreased CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Our results substantiate the claim that "<i>Ca.</i> Tenderia electrophaga" is the key electroautotroph, which will help guide further development of this community for microbial electrosynthesis. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bacteria that directly use electrodes as metabolic electron donors (biocathodes) have been proposed for applications ranging from microbial electrosynthesis to advanced bioelectronics for cellular communication with machines. However, just as we understand very little about oxidation of analogous natural insoluble electron donors, such as iron oxide, the organisms and extracellular electron transfer (EET) pathways underlying the electrode-cell direct electron transfer processes are almost completely unknown. Biocathodes are a stable biofilm cultivation platform to interrogate both the rate and mechanism of EET using electrochemistry and to study the electroautotrophic organisms that catalyze these reactions. Here we provide new evidence supporting the hypothesis that the uncultured bacterium "<i>Candidatus</i> Tenderia electrophaga" directly couples extracellular electron transfer to CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Our results provide insight into developing biocathode technology, such as microbial electrosynthesis, as well as advancing our understanding of chemolithoautotrophy.

publication_nr_4_pubmed_abstract	Microorganisms that respire electrodes may be exploited for biotechnology applications if key pathways for extracellular electron transfer can be identified and manipulated through bioengineering. To determine whether expression of proposed Biocathode-MCL extracellular electron transfer proteins are changed by modulating electrode potential without disrupting the relative distribution of microbial constituents, metaproteomic and 16S rRNA gene expression analyses were performed after switching from an optimal to suboptimal potential based on an expected decrease in electrode respiration. Five hundred and seventy-nine unique proteins were identified across both potentials, the majority of which were assigned to three previously defined Biocathode-MCL metagenomic clusters: a Marinobacter sp., a member of the family Chromatiaceae, and a Labrenzia sp (abbreviated as MCL). Statistical analysis of spectral counts using the Fisher's exact test identified 16 proteins associated with the optimal potential, five of which are predicted electron transfer proteins. The majority of proteins associated with the suboptimal potential were involved in protein turnover/synthesis, motility, and membrane transport. Unipept and 16S rRNA gene expression analyses indicated that the taxonomic profile of the microbiome did not change after 52 h at the suboptimal potential. These findings show that protein expression is sensitive to the electrode potential without inducing shifts in community composition, a feature that may be exploited for engineering Biocathode-MCL. All MS data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001590 (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/dataset/PXD001590).

publication_nr_5_pubmed_abstract	Biocathode extracellular electron transfer (EET) may be exploited for biotechnology applications, including microbially mediated O2 reduction in microbial fuel cells and microbial electrosynthesis. However, biocathode mechanistic studies needed to improve or engineer functionality have been limited to a few select species that form sparse, homogeneous biofilms characterized by little or no growth. Attempts to cultivate isolates from biocathode environmental enrichments often fail due to a lack of some advantage provided by life in a consortium, highlighting the need to study and understand biocathode consortia in situ. Here, we present metagenomic and metaproteomic characterization of a previously described biocathode biofilm (+310 mV versus a standard hydrogen electrode [SHE]) enriched from seawater, reducing O2, and presumably fixing CO2 for biomass generation. Metagenomics identified 16 distinct cluster genomes, 15 of which could be assigned at the family or genus level and whose abundance was roughly divided between Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. A total of 644 proteins were identified from shotgun metaproteomics and have been deposited in the the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001045. Cluster genomes were used to assign the taxonomic identities of 599 proteins, with Marinobacter, Chromatiaceae, and Labrenzia the most represented. RubisCO and phosphoribulokinase, along with 9 other Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle proteins, were identified from Chromatiaceae. In addition, proteins similar to those predicted for iron oxidation pathways of known iron-oxidizing bacteria were observed for Chromatiaceae. These findings represent the first description of putative EET and CO2 fixation mechanisms for a self-regenerating, self-sustaining multispecies biocathode, providing potential targets for functional engineering, as well as new insights into biocathode EET pathways using proteomics.
