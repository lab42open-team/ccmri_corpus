study_name	Comparison of samples and mock communities amplified with single-base variations in 515-Forward universal primer
study_abstract	This study is a comparison of marine environmental and marine mock community samples amplified with different versions of a commonly used universal forward primer 515. A mismatch in the 4th position in the 515F primer to the Thaumarchaea was corrected by replacing the (C) in that position with an ambiguity (N).
