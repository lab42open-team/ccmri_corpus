study_name	Habitat diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality - the importance of direct and indirect effects
study_abstract	Ecosystems worldwide are facing habitat homogenization due to human activities. While it is commonly proposed that such homogenization can have negative repercussions for ecosystem functioning, this remains to be explicitly studied. Here, we expand on the framework for the functional consequences of biodiversity loss, by scaling up from the level of species to the level of entire habitats. Just as species diversity generally begets ecosystem functioning through positive interactions, we hypothesize that different habitats within ecosystems can facilitate each other through structural complementarity and by the exchange of material and energy. We show that experimental ecosystems constituted by a diversity of habitats have higher levels of multiple ecosystem functions compared to ecosystems with low habitat diversity. The effect of habitat diversity on multifunctionality varied with season; it was direct in summer, indirect via changes in species diversity in autumn, whereas there was no effect in spring. We propose that jointly considering habitat and species diversity will prove valuable for both research and environmental management.

Although it is commonly proposed that such habitat homogenization can have negative repercussions for ecosystem functioning, this question has yet to receive explicit scientific attention. We expand on the framework for evaluating the functional consequences of biodiversity loss by scaling up from the level of species to the level of the entire habitats. Just as species diversity generally fosters ecosystem functioning through positive interspecies interactions, we hypothesize that different habitats within ecosystems can facilitate each other through structural complementarity and through exchange of material and energy across habitats. We show that experimental ecosystems comprised of a diversity of habitats show higher levels of multiple ecosystem functions than ecosystems with low habitat diversity. Our results demonstrate that the effect of habitat diversity on multifunctionality varies with season; it has direct effects on ecosystem functioning in summer and indirect effects, via changes in species diversity, in autumn, but no effect in spring. We propose that joint consideration of habitat diversity and species diversity will prove valuable for both environmental management and basic research.
