study_name	Diversity of particle-attached bacteria in the Baltic Sea
study_abstract	To evaluate if changes in salinity affecting diversity of particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) bacteria, we sampled both bacterial fractions in two seasons (summer and fall/winter) in surface waters of three selected stations of the Baltic Sea representing marine, mesohaline and oligohaline environments. All samples were PCR amplified with 30 cycles using the primer pair Bakt_341F (CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and Bakt_805R (ACHVGGGTATCTAATCC). Primers were tailed with sample-specific 5 bp barcodes a 454-adptor region, spanning variable regions V3 and V4 of the 16S rRNA gene. PCR products were purified with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter GmbH, Krefeld, Germany), quantified with a Picogreen assay (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, USA), diluted and equally pooled. The bidirectional sequencing was performed on a 454 platform with Titanium Flex chemistry (Roche etc.).

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Many studies on bacterial community composition (BCC) do not distinguish between particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) bacteria or neglect the PA fraction by pre-filtration removing most particles. Although temporal and spatial gradients in environmental variables are known to shape BCC, it remains unclear how and to what extent PA and FL bacterial diversity responds to such environmental changes. To elucidate the BCC of both bacterial fractions related to different environmental settings, we studied surface samples of three Baltic Sea stations (marine, mesohaline, and oligohaline) in two different seasons (summer and fall/winter). Amplicon sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene revealed significant differences in BCC of both bacterial fractions among stations and seasons, with a particularly high number of PA operational taxonomic units (OTUs at genus-level) at the marine station in both seasons. "Shannon and Simpson indices" showed a higher diversity of PA than FL bacteria at the marine station in both seasons and at the oligohaline station in fall/winter. In general, a high fraction of bacterial OTUs was found exclusively in the PA fraction (52% of total OTUs). These findings indicate that PA bacteria significantly contribute to overall bacterial richness and that they differ from FL bacteria. Therefore, to gain a deeper understanding on diversity and dynamics of aquatic bacteria, PA and FL bacteria should be generally studied independently.
