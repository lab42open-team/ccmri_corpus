study_name	Bacterial communities in sandy sediment at submarine volcanic vents off Panarea Island (Italy)
study_abstract	Benthic bacterial communities composition at submarine natural CO2 vents were investigated to assess the effect of CO2 leakage and consequent seawater acidification on benthic marine microbial assemblages. Sandy sediment samples were collected off Basiluzzo Islet (Panarea Island, Italy) both at CO2 venting areas and at CO2 not impacted area, and DNA was extracted from two different sediment layers (0-2 cm and 4-6 cm). Bacterial communities was described using 454-Massively Parallel Tag Sequencing (454-MPTS).

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Subseabed CO<sub>2</sub> storage is considered a future climate change mitigation technology. We investigated the ecological consequences of CO<sub>2</sub> leakage for a marine benthic ecosystem. For the first time with a multidisciplinary integrated study, we tested hypotheses derived from a meta-analysis of previous experimental and in situ high-CO<sub>2</sub> impact studies. For this, we compared ecological functions of naturally CO<sub>2</sub>-vented seafloor off the Mediterranean island Panarea (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy) to those of nonvented sands, with a focus on biogeochemical processes and microbial and faunal community composition. High CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes (up to 4 to 7 mol CO<sub>2</sub> m<sup>-2</sup> hour<sup>-1</sup>) dissolved all sedimentary carbonate, and comigration of silicate and iron led to local increases of microphytobenthos productivity (+450%) and standing stocks (+300%). Despite the higher food availability, faunal biomass (-80%) and trophic diversity were substantially lower compared to those at the reference site. Bacterial communities were also structurally and functionally affected, most notably in the composition of heterotrophs and microbial sulfate reduction rates (-90%). The observed ecological effects of CO<sub>2</sub> leakage on submarine sands were reproduced with medium-term transplant experiments. This study assesses indicators of environmental impact by CO<sub>2</sub> leakage and finds that community compositions and important ecological functions are permanently altered under high CO<sub>2</sub>.
