study_name	Funtonal metagenomic of salt resistance
study_abstract	Hypersaline environments are considered some of the most extreme habitats on earth and microorganisms have developed diverse molecular mechanisms of adaptation to withstand these conditions. The present study was aimed at identifying novel genes involved in salt resistance from the microbial communities of brines and the rhizosphere of the halophyte Arthrocnemum from the Es Trenc saltern (Mallorca, Spain). The bacterial and archaeal diversity assessed by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed the presence of microbial communities that are typical in such environments. Metagenomic libraries were constructed with DNA from brine and rhizosphere samples, they were transferred to the osmosensitive strain Escherichia coli MKH13, and screened for salt-resistant clones. As a result, a total of eleven genes that confer salt resistance were identified, some of which encode for well known proteins previously related to osmoadaptation as a glycerol and a proton pump, whereas other genes encode for proteins not previously related to this function as RNA and DNA helicases, an endonuclease III (Nth) and hypothetical proteins of unknown function. Furthermore, four of the retrieved genes were cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis and interestingly, three of them exhibited also salt resistance in this bacterium, broadening the spectrum of bacterial species where these genes can operate. This is the first report of salt resistance genes recovered from different metagenomes of a hypersaline environment, which will help to further elucidate novel molecular mechanisms of salt resistance.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Hypersaline environments are considered one of the most extreme habitats on earth and microorganisms have developed diverse molecular mechanisms of adaptation to withstand these conditions. The present study was aimed at identifying novel genes from the microbial communities of a moderate-salinity rhizosphere and brine from the Es Trenc saltern (Mallorca, Spain), which could confer increased salt resistance to Escherichia coli. The microbial diversity assessed by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed the presence of communities that are typical in such environments and the remarkable presence of three bacterial groups never revealed as major components of salt brines. Metagenomic libraries from brine and rhizosphere samples, were transferred to the osmosensitive strain E. coli MKH13, and screened for salt resistance. Eleven genes that conferred salt resistance were identified, some encoding for well-known proteins previously related to osmoadaptation such as a glycerol transporter and a proton pump, whereas others encoded proteins not previously related to this function in microorganisms such as DNA/RNA helicases, an endonuclease III (Nth) and hypothetical proteins of unknown function. Furthermore, four of the retrieved genes were cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis and they also conferred salt resistance to this bacterium, broadening the spectrum of bacterial species in which these genes can function. This is the first report of salt resistance genes recovered from metagenomes of a hypersaline environment.
