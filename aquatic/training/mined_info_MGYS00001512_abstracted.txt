study_name	Postglacial viability and colonization in North America's ice-free corridor
study_abstract	During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) continental ice sheets isolated Beringia (northeast Siberia and northwest North America) from unglaciated North America. By ~15-14 thousand years ago (cal. kyr BP), glacial retreat opened a 1,500-km-long corridor between the ice sheets. It remains unclear when plants and animals colonized this corridor and it became biologically viable for human migration. We obtained radiocarbon dates, pollen, macrofossils and metagenomic DNA from lake sediment cores in a bottleneck portion of the corridor. We find evidence of steppe vegetation, bison and mammoth by ~12.6 cal. kyr BP, followed by open forest, with evidence of moose and elk at ~11.5 cal. kyr BP, and boreal forest ~10 cal. kyr BP. Our findings reveal that the first Americans, whether Clovis or earlier groups in unglaciated North America before 12.6 cal. kyr BP, are unlikely to have travelled this route into the Americas. However, later groups may have used this north-south passageway.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	DNA may be preserved for thousands of years in very cold or dry environments, and plant tissue fragments and pollen trapped in soils and shallow aquatic sediments are well suited for the molecular characterization of past floras. However, one obstacle in this area of study is the limiting bias in the bioinformatic classification of short fragments of degraded DNA from the large, complex genomes of plants. To establish one possible baseline protocol for the rapid classification of short-read shotgun metagenomic data for reconstructing plant communities, the read classification programs Kraken, Centrifuge, and MegaBLAST were tested on simulated and ancient data with classification against a reference database targeting plants. Performance tests on simulated data suggest that Kraken and Centrifuge outperform MegaBLAST. Kraken tends to be the most conservative approach with high precision, whereas Centrifuge has higher sensitivity. Reanalysis of 13,000 years of ancient sedimentary DNA from North America characterizes potential post-glacial vegetation succession. Classification method choice has an impact on performance and any downstream interpretation of results. The reanalysis of ancient DNA from glacial lake sediments yielded vegetation histories that varied depending on method, potentially changing paleoecological conclusions drawn from molecular evidence.
