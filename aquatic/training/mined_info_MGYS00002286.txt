study_name	Metagenomic investigation of six depths from the anchialine Bundera sinkhole
study_abstract	Bundera sinkhole is an anchialine ecosystem located in north-western Australia. It has a highly stratified physico-chemical profile which is reflected in the microbial community structure of each strata. This study is the first to perform shotgun metagenomics on communities inhabiting a selection of depths: 2, 8, 17, 18, 22 and 28 m.
