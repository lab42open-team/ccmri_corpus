publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Environmental sequence data of microbial communities now makes up the majority of public genomic information. The assignment of a function to sequences from these metagenomic sources is challenging because organisms associated with the data are often uncharacterized and not cultivable. To overcome these challenges, we created a rationally designed expression library of metagenomic proteins covering the sequence space of the thioredoxin superfamily. This library of 100 individual proteins represents more than 22,000 thioredoxins found in the Global Ocean Sampling data set. We screened this library for the functional rescue of Escherichia coli mutants lacking the thioredoxin-type reductase (DeltatrxA), isomerase (DeltadsbC), or oxidase (DeltadsbA). We were able to assign functions to more than a quarter of our representative proteins. The in vivo function of a given representative could not be predicted by phylogenetic relation but did correlate with the predicted isoelectric surface potential of the protein. Selected proteins were then purified, and we determined their activity using a standard insulin reduction assay and measured their redox potential. An unexpected gel shift of protein E5 during the redox potential determination revealed a redox cycle distinct from that of typical thioredoxin-superfamily oxidoreductases. Instead of the intramolecular disulfide bond formation typical for thioredoxins, this protein forms an intermolecular disulfide between the attacking cysteines of two separate subunits during its catalytic cycle. Our functional metagenomic approach proved not only useful to assign in vivo functions to representatives of thousands of proteins but also uncovered a novel reaction mechanism in a seemingly well-known protein superfamily.

publication_nr_2_pubmed_abstract	The rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus) is one of the most economically valuable marine fish in East Asia, and due to various environmental factors, there is substantial revenue loss in the production sector. Therefore, knowledge of its genome is required to uncover the genetic factors and the solutions to these problems. In this study, we constructed the first draft genome of O. fasciatus as a reference for the family Oplegnathidae. The genome size is estimated to be 749 Mb, and it was assembled into 766 Mb by combining Illumina and PacBio sequences. A total of 24,053 transcripts (23,338 genes) are predicted, and among those transcripts, 23,362 (97%), are annotated with functional terms. Finally, the completeness of the genome assembly was assessed by CEGMA, which resulted in the complete mapping of 220 (88.7%) core genes in the genome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first draft genome for the family Oplegnathidae.

publication_nr_3_pubmed_abstract	The Ocean Gene Atlas is a web service to explore the biogeography of genes from marine planktonic organisms. It allows users to query protein or nucleotide sequences against global ocean reference gene catalogs. With just one click, the abundance and location of target sequences are visualized on world maps as well as their taxonomic distribution. Interactive results panels allow for adjusting cutoffs for alignment quality and displaying the abundances of genes in the context of environmental features (temperature, nutrients, etc.) measured at the time of sampling. The ease of use enables non-bioinformaticians to explore quantitative and contextualized information on genes of interest in the global ocean ecosystem. Currently the Ocean Gene Atlas is deployed with (i) the Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalog (OM-RGC) comprising 40 million non-redundant mostly prokaryotic gene sequences associated with both Tara Oceans and Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) gene abundances and (ii) the Marine Atlas of Tara Ocean Unigenes (MATOU) composed of &gt;116 million eukaryote unigenes. Additional datasets will be added upon availability of further marine environmental datasets that provide the required complement of sequence assemblies, raw reads and contextual environmental parameters. Ocean Gene Atlas is a freely-available web service at: http://tara-oceans.mio.osupytheas.fr/ocean-gene-atlas/.

publication_nr_4_pubmed_abstract	Prochlorococcus, the smallest known photosynthetic bacterium, is abundant in the ocean's surface layer despite large variation in environmental conditions. There are several genetically divergent lineages within Prochlorococcus and superimposed on this phylogenetic diversity is extensive gene gain and loss. The environmental role in shaping the global ocean distribution of genome diversity in Prochlorococcus is largely unknown, particularly in a framework that considers the vertical and lateral mechanisms of evolution. Here we show that Prochlorococcus field populations from a global circumnavigation harbor extensive genome diversity across the surface ocean, but this diversity is not randomly distributed. We observed a significant correspondence between phylogenetic and gene content diversity, including regional differences in both phylogenetic composition and gene content that were related to environmental factors. Several gene families were strongly associated with specific regions and environmental factors, including the identification of a set of genes related to lower nutrient and temperature regions. Metagenomic assemblies of natural Prochlorococcus genomes reinforced this association by providing linkage of genes across genomic backbones. Overall, our results show that the phylogeography in Prochlorococcus taxonomy is echoed in its genome content. Thus environmental variation shapes the functional capabilities and associated ecosystem role of the globally abundant Prochlorococcus.

publication_nr_5_pubmed_abstract	We have applied "whole-genome shotgun sequencing" to microbial populations collected en masse on tangential flow and impact filters from seawater samples collected from the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda. A total of 1.045 billion base pairs of nonredundant sequence was generated, annotated, and analyzed to elucidate the gene content, diversity, and relative abundance of the organisms within these environmental samples. These data are estimated to derive from at least 1800 genomic species based on sequence relatedness, including 148 previously unknown bacterial phylotypes. We have identified over 1.2 million previously unknown genes represented in these samples, including more than 782 new rhodopsin-like photoreceptors. Variation in species present and stoichiometry suggests substantial oceanic microbial diversity.
