publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The Tara Oceans Consortium has published various metagenomes of marine environmental samples. Here, we report a contig of 2.6 Mbp from the assembly of a sample collected near the Marquesas Islands in the Pacific Ocean, covering a nearly complete novel verrucomicrobial genome. We propose the name "<i>Candidatus</i> Moanabacter tarae" for the corresponding bacterium.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAnPs) are common in marine environments and are associated with photoheterotrophic activity. To date, AAnPs that possess the potential for carbon fixation have not been identified in the surface ocean. Using the Tara Oceans metagenomic dataset, we have identified draft genomes of nine bacteria that possess the genomic potential for anoxygenic phototrophy, carbon fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, and the oxidation of sulfite and thiosulfate. Forming a monophyletic clade within the Alphaproteobacteria and lacking cultured representatives, the organisms compose minor constituents of local microbial communities (0.1-1.0%), but are globally distributed, present in multiple samples from the North Pacific, Mediterranean Sea, the East Africa Coastal Province, and the Atlantic. This discovery may require re-examination of the microbial communities in the oceans to understand and constrain the role this group of organisms may play in the global carbon cycle.
