study_name	Diversity of bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton in coastal waters of Misaki, Japan
study_abstract	Deep sequencing of environmental DNA from surface microlayer obtained using polycarbonate membrane (depth= 33 micrometer), glass plate (depth=42 micrometer) and drum sampler (depth=35 micrometer). The bacterial communities obtained using these three surface microlayer samplers were compared to control underlying water obtained from the depth of 20 cm.
