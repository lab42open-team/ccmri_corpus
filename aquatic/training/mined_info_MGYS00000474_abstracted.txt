study_name	Comparison between raw seawater and two-week enrichment with methanesulfonate
study_abstract	Coastal surface seawater from the North Atlantic ocean was filtered and its metagenome was sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2500. In parallel, half of the sample was filtered and enriched with the addition of methanesulfonate as sole added source of carbon and energy during 16 days following which its metagenome was sequenced by the same method.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Methanesulfonic acid (MSA) is a relevant intermediate of the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur and environmental microorganisms assume an important role in the mineralization of this compound. Several methylotrophic bacterial strains able to grow on MSA have been isolated from soil or marine water and two conserved operons, <i>msmABCD</i> coding for MSA monooxygenase and <i>msmEFGH</i> coding for a transport system, have been repeatedly encountered in most of these strains. Homologous sequences have also been amplified directly from the environment or observed in marine metagenomic data, but these showed a base composition (G + C content) very different from their counterparts from cultivated bacteria. The aim of this study was to understand which microorganisms within the coastal surface oceanic microflora responded to MSA as a nutrient and how the community evolved in the early phases of an enrichment by means of metagenome and gene-targeted amplicon sequencing. From the phylogenetic point of view, the community shifted significantly with the disappearance of all signals related to the <i>Archaea</i>, the <i>Pelagibacteraceae</i> and phylum SAR406, and the increase in methylotroph-harboring taxa, accompanied by other groups so far not known to comprise methylotrophs such as the <i>Hyphomonadaceae</i>. At the functional level, the abundance of several genes related to sulfur metabolism and methylotrophy increased during the enrichment and the allelic distribution of gene <i>msmA</i> diagnostic for MSA monooxygenase altered considerably. Even more dramatic was the disappearance of MSA import-related gene <i>msmE</i>, which suggests that alternative transporters must be present in the enriched community and illustrate the inadequacy of <i>msmE</i> as an ecofunctional marker for MSA degradation at sea.
