study_abstract	This dataset contains the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA sequence information from the Methane Microbial Observatory for Seafloor Analysis (MIMOSA) deployment at GC600 from October 2013 (PE14-09) to March 2014 (PE14-14). The purpose of the deployment was to examine the in situ degradation of oil. The deployment contained flow-through chambers of sediment, one amended with oil and one unamended. Samples were collected from the beginning and end of the experiment.
