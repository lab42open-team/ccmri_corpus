publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The importance of biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning across trophic levels, especially via predatory-prey interactions, is receiving increased recognition. However, this topic has rarely been explored for marine microbes, even though microbial biodiversity contributes significantly to marine ecosystem function and energy flows. Here we examined diversity and biomass of bacteria (prey) and nanoflagellates (predators), as well as their effects on trophic transfer efficiency in the East China Sea. Specifically, we investigated: (i) predator diversity effects on prey biomass and trophic transfer efficiency (using the biomass ratio of predator/prey as a proxy), (ii) prey diversity effects on predator biomass and trophic transfer efficiency, and (iii) the relationship between predator and prey diversity. We found higher prey diversity enhanced both diversity and biomass of predators, as well as trophic transfer efficiency, which may arise from more balanced diet and/or enhanced niche complementarity owing to higher prey diversity. By contrast, no clear effect was detected for predator diversity on prey biomass and transfer efficiency. Notably, we found prey diversity effects on predator-prey interactions; whereas, we found no significant diversity effect on biomass within the same trophic level. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multi-trophic biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning in natural ecosystems.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	A central challenge in microbial ecology is to understand the underlying mechanisms driving community assembly, particularly in the continuum of species sorting and dispersal limitation. However, little is known about the relative importance of species sorting and dispersal limitation in shaping marine microbial communities; especially, how they are related to organism types/traits and water depth. Here, we used variation partitioning and null model analysis to compare mechanisms driving bacterial and protist metacommunity dynamics at the basin scale in the East China Sea, based on MiSeq paired-end sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and 18S rDNA, respectively, in surface, deep chlorophyll maximum and bottom layers. Our analyses indicated that protist communities were governed more strongly by species sorting relative to dispersal limitation than were bacterial communities; this pattern was consistent across the three-depth layers, albeit to different degrees. Furthermore, we detected that bacteria exhibited wider habitat niche breadths than protists, whereas, passive dispersal abilities were not appreciably different between them. Our findings support the 'size-plasticity' hypothesis: smaller organisms (bacteria) are less environment filtered than larger organisms (protists), as smaller organisms are more likely to be plastic in metabolic abilities and have greater environmental tolerance.
