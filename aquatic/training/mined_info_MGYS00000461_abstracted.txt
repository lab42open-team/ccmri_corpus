study_name	Reconstructing the ecosystem functions of the active microbial community within Baltic Sea oxygen depleted sediments
study_abstract	In the present study, we sought to establish whether and to what extent the functional capacities were actually expressed in the Landsort Deep anoxic sediment, using a metatranscriptomic approach. Specifically, given the global extension of anoxic ?dead zones? and the global importance of marine sediment as carbon sink, we were interested to investigate if, and how, the sediment community of the anoxic Landsort Deep sediment mineralized the accumulating carbon. Results reveal the extent of what ecosystem functions, and which nutrient recycling processes, the anoxic sediment microbial communities contribute to. This is knowledge which is important to the decision support tools underlying the Helsinki Commission Baltic Sea Action Plan.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Baltic Sea deep water and sediments hold one of the largest anthropogenically induced hypoxic areas in the world. High nutrient input and low water exchange result in eutrophication and oxygen depletion below the halocline. As a consequence at Landsort Deep, the deepest point of the Baltic Sea, anoxia in the sediments has been a persistent condition over the past decades. Given that microbial communities are drivers of essential ecosystem functions we investigated the microbial community metabolisms and functions of oxygen depleted Landsort Deep sediments by metatranscriptomics. Results show substantial expression of genes involved in protein metabolism demonstrating that the Landsort Deep sediment microbial community is active. Identified expressed gene suites of metabolic pathways with importance for carbon transformation including fermentation, dissimilatory sulphate reduction and methanogenesis were identified. The presence of transcripts for these metabolic processes suggests a potential for heterotrophic-autotrophic community synergism and indicates active mineralisation of the organic matter deposited at the sediment as a consequence of the eutrophication process. Furthermore, cyanobacteria, probably deposited from the water column, are transcriptionally active in the anoxic sediment at this depth. Results also reveal high abundance of transcripts encoding integron integrases. These results provide insight into the activity of the microbial community of the anoxic sediment at the deepest point of the Baltic Sea and its possible role in ecosystem functioning.
