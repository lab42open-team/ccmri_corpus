study_name	Metagenomic analysis of an Iranian Hypersaline Lake microbial ecosystem
study_abstract	We studied microbial communities in three different stations of an Iranian Hypersaline Lake (Lake Meyghan). These stations are characterized by a salinity ranging from 5%, 20% to over 30% total salt and a slightly alkaline Ph range (from 7.7 to 8.8). The microbial communities are dominated by Archaea at higher salinity and by Bacteria at lower salinity.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The halophilic myohalovirus <i>Halobacterium virus phiH</i> (PhiH) was first described in 1982 and was isolated from a spontaneously lysed culture of <i>Halobacterium salinarum</i> strain R1. Until 1994, it was used extensively as a model to study the molecular genetics of haloarchaea, but only parts of the viral genome were sequenced during this period. Using Sanger sequencing combined with high-coverage Illumina sequencing, the full genome sequence of the major variant (phiH1) of this halovirus has been determined. The dsDNA genome is 58,072 bp in length and carries 97 protein-coding genes. We have integrated this information with the previously described transcription mapping data. PhiH could be classified into Myoviridae Type1, Cluster 4 based on capsid assembly and structural proteins (VIRFAM). The closest relative was <i>Natrialba</i> virus phiCh1 (PhiCh1), which shared 63% nucleotide identity and displayed a high level of gene synteny. This close relationship was supported by phylogenetic tree reconstructions. The complete sequence of this historically important virus will allow its inclusion in studies of comparative genomics and virus diversity.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Lake Meyghan is one of the largest and commercially most important salt lakes in Iran. Despite its inland location and high altitude, Lake Meyghan has a thalassohaline salt composition suggesting a marine origin. Inputs of fresh water by rivers and rainfall formed various basins characterized by different salinities. We analyzed the microbial community composition of three basins by isolation and culturing of microorganisms and by analysis of the metagenome. The basins that were investigated comprised a green ~50 g kg<sup>-1</sup> salinity brine, a red ~180 g kg<sup>-1</sup> salinity brine and a white ~300 g kg<sup>-1</sup> salinity brine. Using different growth media, 57 strains of Bacteria and 48 strains of Archaea were isolated. Two bacterial isolates represent potential novel species with less than 96% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to known species. Abundant isolates were also well represented in the metagenome. Bacteria dominated the low salinity brine, with Alteromonadales (Gammaproteobacteria) as a particularly important taxon, whereas the high salinity brines were dominated by haloarchaea. Although the brines of Lake Meyghan differ in geochemical composition, their ecosystem function appears largely conserved amongst each other while being driven by different microbial communities.
