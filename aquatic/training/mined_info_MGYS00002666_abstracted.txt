publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Fecal pollution at coastal beaches requires management efforts to address public health and economic concerns. Feces-borne bacterial concentrations are influenced by different fecal sources, environmental conditions, and ecosystem reservoirs, making their public health significance convoluted. In this study, we sought to delineate the influences of these factors on enterococcal concentrations in southern Maine coastal recreational waters. Weekly water samples and water quality measurements were conducted at freshwater, estuarine, and marine beach sites from June through September 2016. The samples were analyzed for total and particle-associated enterococcal concentrations, total suspended solids, and microbial source tracking markers (PCR: Bac32, HF183, CF128, DF475, and Gull2; quantitative PCR [qPCR]: AllBac, HF183, and GFD). Water, soil, sediment, and marine sediment samples were also subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing and SourceTracker analysis to determine the influence from these environmental reservoirs on water sample microbial communities. Enterococcal and particle-associated enterococcal concentrations were elevated in freshwater, but the concentrations of suspended solids were relatively similar. Mammal fecal contamination was significantly elevated in the estuary, with human and bird fecal contaminant levels similar between sites. A partial least-squares regression model indicated particle-associated enterococcal and mammal marker concentrations had the most significant positive relationships with enterococcal concentrations across marine, estuary, and freshwater environments. Freshwater microbial communities were significantly influenced by underlying sediment, while estuarine/marine beach communities were influenced by freshwater, high tide height, and estuarine sediment. Elevated enterococcal levels were reflective of a combination of increased fecal source input, environmental sources, and environmental conditions, highlighting the need for encompassing microbial source tracking (MST) approaches for managing water quality issues.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Enterococci have long been the federal standard in determining water quality at estuarine and marine environments. Although enterococci are highly abundant in the intestines of many animals, they are not exclusive to that environment and can persist and grow outside fecal tracts. This presents a management problem for areas that are largely impaired by nonpoint source contamination, as fecal sources might not be the root cause of contamination. This study employed different microbial source tracking methods for delineating the influences from fecal source input, environmental sources, and environmental conditions to determine which combination of variables are influencing enterococcal concentrations in recreational waters at a historically impaired coastal town. The results showed that fecal source input, environmental sources, and conditions all play roles in influencing enterococcal concentrations. This highlights the need to include an encompassing microbial source tracking approach to assess the effects of all important variables on enterococcal concentrations.
