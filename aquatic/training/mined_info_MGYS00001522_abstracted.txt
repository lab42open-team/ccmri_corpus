study_name	Metagenomic analysis of microbial CpG methylation in Delaware estuarine riverbank sediment
study_abstract	Marine sediments harbor a vast amount of Earth?s microbial biomass, yet little is understood regarding how cells subsist in these low-energy environments without forming endospores. DNA methylation, a reversible process that involves the addition of a methyl group to a nucleotide base via a methyltransferase, exists as a possible epigenetic mechanism for non-sporulated cells in low-energy sediment environments to regulate gene expression and potentially lower cellular activity. To investigate the presence and scope of this phenomenon in estuarine sediment microbial communities, we sequenced three metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries extracted from a sediment core collected from the banks of the Oyster Rocks site of the Broadkill River, Milton, Delaware, USA. We targeted 5-methylcytosine at CpG sites by digesting metagenomic libraries with the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII. By quantitatively distinguishing ?mixed? methylation states for populations of CpG site copies, we identified dynamic, non-binary shifts in CpG methylation for community taxa and function.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Marine sediments harbor a vast amount of Earth's microbial biomass, yet little is understood regarding how cells subsist in this low-energy, presumably slow-growth environment. Cells in marine sediments may require additional methods for genetic regulation, such as epigenetic modification <i>via</i> DNA methylation. We investigated this potential phenomenon within a shallow estuary sediment core spanning 100 years of age. Here, we provide evidence of dynamic community m5-cytosine methylation within estuarine sediment metagenomes. The methylation states of individual CpG sites were reconstructed and quantified across three depths within the sediment core. A total of 6,254 CpG sites were aligned for direct comparison of methylation states between samples, and 4,235 of these sites mapped to taxa and genes. Our results demonstrate the presence of differential methylation within environmental CpG sites across an age gradient of sediment. We show that epigenetic modification can be detected <i>via</i> Illumina sequencing within complex environmental communities. The change in methylation state of environmentally relevant genes across depths may indicate a dynamic role of DNA methylation in regulation of biogeochemical processes.
