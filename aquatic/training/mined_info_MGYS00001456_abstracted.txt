study_name	Sediment microbial diversity from samples of the lagoons of the Amvrakikos Gulf (Ionian Sea, Western Greece).
study_abstract	The aim of the present study was to explore the biodiversity patterns of microorganismic assemblages and to examine whether these patterns are associated with those of the contextual environmental parameters. For this purpose, sediment samples were collected from five lagoons (Rodia, Tsoukalio, Tsopeli, Mazoma, Logarou), located in Amvrakikos Gulf (Ionian Sea, Western Greece). In each lagoon, two sampling stations were chosen, with different connectivity degree with the sea. A number of abiotic parameters were measured for every station, including the sediment concentrations of heavy metals and elements. Microbial DNA was extracted from the sediment upper layer (0-2cm) and was further processed through deep sequencing of the V5-V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene by next generation sequencing.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Lagoons are naturally enriched habitats, with unstable environmental conditions caused by their confinement, shallow depth and state of saprobity. The frequent fluctuations of the abiotic variables cause severe changes in the abundance and distribution of biota. This relationship has been studied extensively for the macrofaunal communities, but not sufficiently so for the bacterial ones. The aim of the present study was to explore the biodiversity patterns of bacterial assemblages and to examine whether these patterns are associated with biogeographic and environmental factors. For this purpose, sediment samples were collected from five lagoons located in the Amvrakikos Gulf (Ionian Sea, Western Greece). DNA was extracted from the sediment and was further processed through 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. The results of this exploratory study imply that salinity is the environmental factor best correlated with the bacterial community pattern, which has also been suggested in similar studies but for macrofaunal community patterns. In addition, the bacterial community of the brackish lagoons is differentiated from that of the brackish-marine lagoons. The findings of this study indicate that the studied lagoons have distinct bacterial communities.
