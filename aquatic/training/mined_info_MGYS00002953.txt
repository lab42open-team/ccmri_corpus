study_name	16S data describing Antarctic benthic sediment
study_abstract	Here, we collected twenty-four sediments samples over a 5,500 km transect of western Antarctica that spans the Ross Sea up to the Weddle Sea. Diversity data from all three domains of life were collected via next-generation DNA sequencing and numerous geochemical and nutrient data were also collected, which greatly contributes to the existing understanding of benthic Antarctic sediments communities.
