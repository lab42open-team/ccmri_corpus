study_abstract	The Mesolithic to Neolithic transition in Europe marked the transition of humans from hunter-gathers to agriculturalists. This event coincided with rising sea levels in the area and submergence of numerous paleosols, obscuring the earliest evidence of the transition from the archaeological record. A combination of archaeological and molecular approaches of sediment cores dating from 8030-7980 cal BP show the presence of domesticated plant species, suggesting neolithicisation of the area 2,000 years earlier than expected. The submitted raw sequence data here correspond to four strata of a core sample within this time range. Using a shotgun metagenomic approach we identified sequences of domesticated plant species amongst background ecology of the early Neolithic, around 8,000 cal BP.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Contamination with exogenous DNA is a constant hazard to ancient DNA studies, since their validity greatly depend on the ancient origin of the retrieved sequences. Since contamination occurs sporadically, it is fundamental to show positive evidence for the authenticity of ancient DNA sequences even when preventive measures to avoid contamination are implemented. Recently the presence of wheat in the United Kingdom 8000 years before the present has been reported based on an analysis of sedimentary ancient DNA (Smith et al. 2015). Smith et al. did not present any positive evidence for the authenticity of their results due to the small number of sequencing reads that were confidently assigned to wheat. We developed a computational method that compares postmortem damage patterns of a test dataset with bona fide ancient and modern DNA. We applied this test to the putative wheat DNA and find that these reads are most likely not of ancient origin.
