study_name	Analysing core microbiome of the Alpine bog vegetation
study_abstract	The current study address microbial diversity of Alpine bog vegetation using deep-sequencing of microbial 16S rRNA genes. Higher plant, bryophyte and lichen species were sampled from plots (1m2) in two Austrian bogs, Rotmoos and P?rgschachen Moor. The plots were dominated by Sphagnum magellanicum or Sphagnum angustifolium. Altogether, 46 plant and lichen samples of 24 species were collected. Amplicons were generated using 515F/806R (Caporaso et al. 2010 PNAS) and were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq v2 platform.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The <i>Archaea</i> represent a significant component of the plant microbiome, whereas their function is still unclear. Different plant species representing the natural vegetation of alpine bogs harbor a substantial archaeal community originating from five phyla, 60 genera, and 334 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We identified a core archaeome for all bog plants and ecosystem-specific, so far unclassified <i>Archaea</i> In the metagenomic data set, <i>Archaea</i> were found to have the potential to interact with plants by (i) possible plant growth promotion through auxin biosynthesis, (ii) nutrient supply, and (iii) protection against abiotic (especially oxidative and osmotic) stress. The unexpectedly high degree of plant specificity supports plant-archaeon interactions. Moreover, functional signatures of <i>Archaea</i> reveal genetic capacity for the interplay with fungi and an important role in the carbon and nitrogen cycle: e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> fixation. These facts reveal an important, yet unobserved role of the <i>Archaea</i> for plants as well as for the bog ecosystem.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>Archaea</i> are still an underdetected and little-studied part of the plant microbiome. We provide first and novel insights into <i>Archaea</i> as a functional component of the plant microbiome obtained by metagenomic analyses. <i>Archaea</i> were found to have the potential to interact with plants by (i) plant growth promotion through auxin biosynthesis, (ii) nutrient supply, and (iii) protection against abiotic stress.
