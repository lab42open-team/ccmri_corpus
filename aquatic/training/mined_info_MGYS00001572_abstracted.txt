study_name	Microbial communities in deep crystalline bedrock aquifers of Olkiluoto, Finkand
study_abstract	The deep subsurface microbial communities in the crystalline bedrock aquifers of Olkiluoto, Finland, were studied. The actively transcribing community was examined by targeting the archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA and the mRNA transcripts of the mcrA genes of the methanogens and the dsrB gene transcripts of the sulphate reducers using 454 amplicon sequencing.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Active microbial communities of deep crystalline bedrock fracture water were investigated from seven different boreholes in Olkiluoto (Western Finland) using bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA, dsrB, and mcrA gene transcript targeted 454 pyrosequencing. Over a depth range of 296-798 m below ground surface the microbial communities changed according to depth, salinity gradient, and sulphate and methane concentrations. The highest bacterial diversity was observed in the sulphate-methane mixing zone (SMMZ) at 250-350 m depth, whereas archaeal diversity was highest in the lowest boundaries of the SMMZ. Sulphide-oxidizing Epsilon-proteobacteria (Sulfurimonas sp.) dominated in the SMMZ and Gamma-proteobacteria (Pseudomonas spp.) below the SMMZ. The active archaeal communities consisted mostly of ANME-2D and Thermoplasmatales groups, although Methermicoccaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, and Thermoplasmatales (SAGMEG, TMG) were more common at 415-559 m depth. Typical indicator microorganisms for sulphate-methane transition zones in marine sediments, such as ANME-1 archaea, Alfa-, Beta- and Delta-proteobacteria, JS1, Actinomycetes, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, and MBGB Crenarchaeota were detected at specific depths. DsrB genes were most numerous and most actively transcribed in the SMMZ while the mcrA gene concentration was highest in the deep methane rich groundwater. Our results demonstrate that active and highly diverse but sparse and stratified microbial communities inhabit the Fennoscandian deep bedrock ecosystems.
