study_abstract	Biodiversity is at present receiving increasing attention due to need of conservation and sustainable utilization. Proper sampling and identification of organisms at the baseline is prerequisite to monitor any disturbances in future. This is particularly significant in the context of sea level rise and climate changes. The Indian coastal and marine habitat includes near shore, creeks, tidal flats, mud flats, coastal dunes, mangroves, seaweed, sea grass beds and coral reefs. These marine habitats are potential natural resources playing significant role in ecological and economic stabilities of the country. The present study aims at to inventorize the present microbial diversity on Indian coast and construct a detailed strategy for bridging the gaps with sampling plan for creating a database available in public domain.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	This is a pioneering report on the metagenomic exploration of the bacterial diversity from a busy sea port in Paradip, Odisha, India. In our study, high-throughput sequencing of community 16S rRNA gene amplicon was performed using 454 GS Junior platform. Metagenome contain 34,121 sequences with 16,677,333 bp and 56.3% G + C content. Metagenome sequences data are now available at NCBI under the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database with accession no. SRX897055. Community metagenome sequence revealed the presence of 11,705 species belonging to 40 different phyla. Bacteroidetes (23%), Firmicutes (19%), Proteobacteria (17%), Spirochaetes (10%), Nitrospirae (8%), Actinobacteria (7%) and Acidobacteria (3%) are the predominant bacterial phyla in this port soil. Analysis of metagenomic sequences unfolded the interesting distribution of several phyla which pointed to the significant anthropogenic intervention influencing the bacterial community character of this port.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Brackish water lake is the most extraordinary reservoir for bacterial community with an adaptability of tolerance to saline stress. In the present study, metagenomic approach was implemented utilising 454-pyrosequencing platform to gain deeper insights into the bacterial diversity profile of the soil sediment of Chilika Lake, Odisha, India. Metagenome contained 68,150 sequences with 31,896,430 bp and 56.79% G + C content. Metagenome sequences data are now available at NCBI under the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database with accession no. SRX753382. Bacterial community metagenome sequences were analysed by MG-RAST server representing the presence of 16,212 species belonging to 45 different phyla. The dominating phyla were Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes. The analysis of bacterial community datasets obtained from two different saline soil sediments revealed significant differences in bacterial community composition and diversity value providing better understanding of the ecosystem dynamics of Chilika Lake.
