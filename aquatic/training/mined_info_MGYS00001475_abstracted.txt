study_name	Capturing early changes in the marine bacterial community as a result of crude oil pollution in a mesocosm experiment
study_abstract	Shifts in marine bacterial communities resulting from crude oil contamination were characterized by 16S rDNA PCR ? DGGE and 454 high-throughput sequencing with the aims to 1) reveal short-term changes in the structure of the marine bacterial community 2) identify the blooming bacteria resulting from oil occurrence by DNA analysis. A longer-term vision of this study is to use a selection of bacterial genes markers in combination with monitoring technology to sense and warn for oil contamination. Here, we present results obtained from seawater incubations with North Sea oil in absence (O) or presence (OD) of dispersant, carried out at low temperature (4 ?C) and in the presence of zooplankton. Despite the dispersant treatment, chemistry in O and OD was very similar possibly due to the setup with low mixing energy. Both O and OD treatments induced rapid (1 day) re-arrangement of bacterial community and enrichment of Pseudoalteromonas, Pseudomonas, Glaciecola, known as biosurfactant producers, as well as bacteria assigned to Sulfitobacter, Piscirickettsiaceae (Marine Methylotrophic Group 3), Neptunomonas and Vibrio. Pseudofulvibacter genus was enriched by oil in the treatment without dispersant. The oil- contaminated seawater contained bacterial genera of Polaribacter and Marinomonas identical in 98 -99 % to those found in the North Sea crude oil itself. This suggests that bacteria blooming in oil-contaminated seawater can also stem from the bacterial community in oil itself and contribute to the structural community shift observed.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The results of marine bacterial community succession from a short-term study of seawater incubations at 4C to North Sea crude oil are presented herein. Oil was used alone (O) or in combination with a dispersant (OD). Marine bacterial communities resulting from these incubations were characterized by a fingerprinting analysis and pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene with the aim of 1) revealing differences in bacterial communities between the control, O treatment, and OD treatment and 2) identifying the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of early responders in order to define the bacterial gene markers of oil pollution for in situ monitoring.After an incubation for 1 d, the distribution of the individual ribotypes of bacterial communities in control and oil-treated (O and OD) tanks differed. Differences related to the structures of bacterial communities were observed at later stages of the incubation. Among the early responders identified (Pseudoalteromonas, Sulfitobacter, Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Glaciecola, Neptunomonas, Methylophaga, and Pseudofulvibacter), genera that utilize a disintegrated biomass or hydrocarbons as well as biosurfactant producers were detected. None of these genera included obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB). After an incubation for 1 d, the abundances of Glaciecola and Pseudofulvibacter were approximately 30-fold higher in the OD and O tanks than in the control tank. OTUs assigned to the Glaciecola genus were represented more in the OD tank, while those of Pseudofulvibacter were represented more in the O tank. We also found that 2 to 3% of the structural community shift originated from the bacterial community in the oil itself, with Polaribacter being a dominant bacterium.
