study_name	Enrichment of organohalide respiring bacteria
study_abstract	Organohalide respiring bacteria are difficult to enrich and isolate, which can limit research on these important organisms. The goal of this research was to develop a method to rapidly (minutes to days) enrich these organisms from a mixed culture or sediment sample. The method presented herein was based on the hypothesis that organohalide respiring bacteria would be more hydrophobic than other bacteria as a result of their niche dehalogenating hydrophobic compounds. To test this hypothesis, a method was developed to separate putative organohalide respiring bacteria at the interface between a hydrophobic organic solvent and aqueous media. This novel separation technique was tested with a sediment-free culture, a tetrachloroethene-enriched digester culture, and sediment from an uncontaminated lake.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Organohalide-respiring bacteria can be difficult to enrich and isolate, which can limit research on these important organisms. The goal of this research was to develop a method to rapidly (minutes to days) enrich these organisms from a mixed community. The method presented is based on the hypothesis that organohalide-respiring bacteria would be more hydrophobic than other bacteria as they dehalogenate hydrophobic compounds. The method developed tests this hypothesis by separating a portion of putative organohalide-respiring bacteria, those phylogenetically related to <i>Dehalococcoides mccartyi</i>, at the interface between a hydrophobic organic solvent and an aqueous medium. This novel partial separation technique was tested with a polychlorinated biphenyl-enriched sediment-free culture, a tetrachloroethene-enriched digester sludge culture, and uncontaminated lake sediment. Significantly higher fractions, up to 20.4 times higher, of putative organohalide-respiring bacteria were enriched at the interface between the medium and either hexadecane or trichloroethene. The selective partial separation of these putative organohalide-respiring bacteria occurred after 20 min, strongly suggesting that the separation was a result of physical-chemical interactions between the cell surface and hydrophobic solvent. Dechlorination activity postseparation was verified by the production of <i>cis</i>-dichloroethene when amended with tetrachloroethene. A longer incubation time of 6 days prior to separation with trichloroethene increased the total number of putative organohalide-respiring bacteria. This method provides a way to quickly separate some of the putative organohalide-respiring bacteria from other bacteria, thereby improving our ability to study multiple and different bacteria of potential interest and improving knowledge of these bacteria.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Organohalide-respiring bacteria, bacteria capable of respiring chlorinated contaminants, can be difficult to enrich, which can limit their predictable use for the bioremediation of contaminated sites. This paper describes a method to quickly separate <i>Dehalococcoides</i>-like bacteria, a group of organisms containing organohalide-respiring bacteria, from other bacteria in a mixed community. From this work, <i>Dehalococcoides</i>-like bacteria appear to have a hydrophobic cell surface, facilitating a rapid (20 min) partial separation from a mixed culture at the surface of a hydrophobic liquid. This method was verified in a polychlorinated biphenyl-enriched sediment-free culture, an anaerobic digester sludge, and uncontaminated sediment. The method described can drastically reduce the amount of time required to partially separate <i>Dehalococcoides</i>-like bacteria from a complex mixed culture, improving researchers' ability to study these important bacteria.
