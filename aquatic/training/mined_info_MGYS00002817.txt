study_name	Cascading influence of inorganic nitrogen sources on DOM production composition lability and microbial community structure in the open ocean
study_abstract	We evaluated the potential for abrupt increases in inorganic N sources to induce cascading effects on DOM and microbial communities in the surface ocean. We collected water from 5 m depth in the central North Pacific and amended duplicate 20 L polycarbonate carboys with nitrate or ammonium, tracking planktonic carbon fixation DOM production DOM composition and microbial community structure responses over 1 week relative to controls
