study_name	Deep sequencing of 16S rRNA gene reveals discrete series of microbial community succession in tropical drinking water treatment plant
study_abstract	Microbial community dynamics in drinking water treatment plant are remarkably understudied, despite the high demand of microbiologically safe drinking water supplies. In this study, data on coherent dynamics of taxa- and microbial community shifts along the treatment barriers of drinking water treatment plant are reported. By sequencing the 16S rRNA gene amplicon at adequate depth, a high degree of microbial diversity and overrepresentation of typical freshwater genera including Undibacterium, Novosphingobium and Cylindrospermopsis were observed. Undibacterium had a considerable contribution to the abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria and demonstrated a remarkable ability to predict microbial diversity. Shifts in community structure were due to substantial elimination of bacterial taxa by sand filtration, and significant enrichment of rare taxa following chlorination. Coherent dynamics of taxa across treatment barriers revealed series of discrete microbial secondary successions punctuated by treatment barriers. Based on microbial community succession data, the fate of noxious bacteria in drinking water treatment plants can be tracked.
