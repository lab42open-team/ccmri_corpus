publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Diatoms usually dominate phytoplankton blooms in open oceans, exhibiting extremely high population densities. Although the iron uptake rate of diatoms largely determines the magnitude and longevity of diatom blooms, the underlying mechanisms regulating iron uptake remain unclear. The transcription of two iron uptake proteins, ISIP2a and ISIP1, in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum was enhanced with increasing cell density, whereas the cellular iron content showed the opposite trend. When compared with the wild-type strain, knockdown of ISIP2a resulted in 43% decrease in cellular iron content, implying the involvement of ISIP2a in iron uptake under high-cell density conditions. Incubation of the diatom cells with sonicated cell lysate conditioned by different cell densities did not affect ISIP2a and ISIP1 expression, ruling out regulation via chemical cues. In contrast, ISIP2a and ISIP1 transcription were strongly induced by red light. Besides, chlorophyll fluorescence excited from the blue light was also positively correlated with population density. Subsequently, a "sandwich" illumination incubator was designed to filter out stray light and ensure that the inner layer cells only receive the emitted chlorophyll fluorescence from outer layers, and the results showed that the increase in outer cell density significantly elevated ISIP2a and ISIP1 transcription in inner layer cells. In situ evidence from Tara oceans also showed positively correlated between diatom ISIP transcripts and chlorophyll content. This study shows that chlorophyll fluorescence derived from neighboring cells is able to upregulate ISIP2a and ISIP1 expression to facilitate iron assimilation under high-cell density. These results provide novel insights into biotic signal sensing in phytoplankton, which can help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of marine diatom blooms.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Most of the research on the cycling of carbon in the open-ocean has focused on heterotrophic prokaryotes and eukaryotic phytoplankton, but the role of pelagic fungi remains largely enigmatic. Here, we performed a global-ocean multi-omics analysis of all pelagic fungal carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), key enzymes in the carbon cycling. We studied the occurrence, expression, diversity, functional classification, and taxonomic affiliation of the genes encoding all pelagic fungal CAZymes from the epi- and mesopelagic realm. Pelagic fungi are active in carbohydrate degradation as indicated by a high ratio of CAZymes transcripts per gene. Dothideomycetes in epipelagic and the Leotiomycetes in mesopelagic waters (both from the phylum Ascomycota) are the main pelagic fungi responsible for carbohydrate degradation in the ocean. The abundance, expression, and diversity of fungal CAZymes were higher in the mesopelagic than in the epipelagic waters, in contrast to the distribution pattern of prokaryotic CAZymes. Our results reveal a widespread utilization of different types of CAZymes by pelagic fungi, uncovering an active and hitherto largely unexplored participation of fungi in the pelagic C cycling, where pelagic prokaryotes and fungi occupy different ecological niches, and fungi becoming relatively more important with depth.

publication_nr_2_pubmed_abstract	Large-scale metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data analyses are often restricted by their gene-centric approach, limiting the ability to understand organismal and community biology. De novo assembly of large and mosaic eukaryotic genomes from complex meta-omics data remains a challenging task, especially in comparison with more straightforward bacterial and archaeal systems. Here, we use a transcriptome reconstruction method based on clustering co-abundant genes across a series of metagenomic samples. We investigated the co-abundance patterns of ~37 million eukaryotic unigenes across 365 metagenomic samples collected during the <i>Tara</i> Oceans expeditions to assess the diversity and functional profiles of marine plankton. We identified ~12,000 co-abundant gene groups (CAGs), encompassing ~7 million unigenes, including 924 metagenomics-based transcriptomes (MGTs, CAGs larger than 500 unigenes). We demonstrated the biological validity of the MGT collection by comparing individual MGTs with available references. We identified several key eukaryotic organisms involved in dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) biosynthesis and catabolism in different oceanic provinces, thus demonstrating the potential of the MGT collection to provide functional insights on eukaryotic plankton. We established the ability of the MGT approach to capture interspecies associations through the analysis of a nitrogen-fixing haptophyte-cyanobacterial symbiotic association. This MGT collection provides a valuable resource for analyses of eukaryotic plankton in the open ocean by giving access to the genomic content and functional potential of many ecologically relevant eukaryotic species.

publication_nr_3_pubmed_abstract	The Ocean Gene Atlas is a web service to explore the biogeography of genes from marine planktonic organisms. It allows users to query protein or nucleotide sequences against global ocean reference gene catalogs. With just one click, the abundance and location of target sequences are visualized on world maps as well as their taxonomic distribution. Interactive results panels allow for adjusting cutoffs for alignment quality and displaying the abundances of genes in the context of environmental features (temperature, nutrients, etc.) measured at the time of sampling. The ease of use enables non-bioinformaticians to explore quantitative and contextualized information on genes of interest in the global ocean ecosystem. Currently the Ocean Gene Atlas is deployed with (i) the Ocean Microbial Reference Gene Catalog (OM-RGC) comprising 40 million non-redundant mostly prokaryotic gene sequences associated with both Tara Oceans and Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) gene abundances and (ii) the Marine Atlas of Tara Ocean Unigenes (MATOU) composed of &gt;116 million eukaryote unigenes. Additional datasets will be added upon availability of further marine environmental datasets that provide the required complement of sequence assemblies, raw reads and contextual environmental parameters. Ocean Gene Atlas is a freely-available web service at: http://tara-oceans.mio.osupytheas.fr/ocean-gene-atlas/.

publication_nr_4_pubmed_abstract	While our knowledge about the roles of microbes and viruses in the ocean has increased tremendously due to recent advances in genomics and metagenomics, research on marine microbial eukaryotes and zooplankton has benefited much less from these new technologies because of their larger genomes, their enormous diversity, and largely unexplored physiologies. Here, we use a metatranscriptomics approach to capture expressed genes in open ocean Tara Oceans stations across four organismal size fractions. The individual sequence reads cluster into 116 million unigenes representing the largest reference collection of eukaryotic transcripts from any single biome. The catalog is used to unveil functions expressed by eukaryotic marine plankton, and to assess their functional biogeography. Almost half of the sequences have no similarity with known proteins, and a great number belong to new gene families with a restricted distribution in the ocean. Overall, the resource provides the foundations for exploring the roles of marine eukaryotes in ocean ecology and biogeochemistry.
