study_name	Bioremediation and metal resistant bacteria in a closed, cold northern mine
study_abstract	Closed, water filled mined produce heavy metal rich acid mine draining that affects the environment in many ways. In this study we have characterized the bacterial community on the water of closed Kotalahti mine by 16S rRNA gene targeted 454 amplicon sequencing as well as by heavy metal resistance gene targeting clone libraries combined with Sanger sequencing.
