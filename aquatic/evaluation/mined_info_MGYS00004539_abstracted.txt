study_abstract	Red conger eel (Genypterus chilensis, Guichenot) is a native Chilean species whose meat is characterized by high gastronomic demand and is now part of the Chilean aquaculture diversification program. Two disease outbreaks derived from its intensified aquaculture farming have been reported and were associated with Vibrio spp. and Tenacibaculum spp. However, the role of individual species is not clear because there is a lack of information about the bacterial community composition associated with the rearing environment of healthy specimens of this fish species. This study examined the microbial community in the seawater of a G. chilensis aquaculture facility using both culture-based methods and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V4V5 region using Illumina MiSeq.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The red conger eel (<i>Genypterus chilensis</i>, Guichenot) is a native species included in the Chilean Aquaculture Diversification Program due to high commercial demand. In the context of intensified farming, prior reports link two disease outbreaks with emerging pathogens in the <i>Vibrio</i> and <i>Tenacibaculum</i> genera. However, the roles remain unclear for the bacterial community and each specific bacterium is associated with the rearing environment for healthy specimens. The success of red conger eel farming therefore warrants research into the bacterial composition of aquaculture conditions and the antimicrobial susceptibilities thereof. This study used culturing methods and high-throughput sequencing to describe the bacterial community associated with water in which <i>G. chilensis</i> was farmed. With culturing methods, the predominant genera were <i>Vibrio</i> (21.6%), <i>Pseudolteromonas</i> (15.7%), <i>Aliivibrio</i> (13.7%), and <i>Shewanella</i> (7.8%). Only a few bacterial isolates showed amylase, gelatinase, or lipase activity, and almost all showed inhibition zones to commonly-used antibiotics in aquaculture. By contrast, high-throughput sequencing established <i>Paraperlucidibaca</i>, <i>Colwellia</i>, <i>Polaribacter</i>, <i>Saprospiraceae</i>, and <i>Tenacibaculum</i> as the predominant genera, with <i>Vibrio</i> ranking twenty-seventh in abundance. High-throughput sequencing also established a link between previous outbreaks with increased relative abundances of <i>Vibrio</i> and <i>Tenacibaculum</i>. Therefore, monitoring the presence and abundance of these potential pathogens could be useful in providing prophylactic measures to prevent future outbreaks.
