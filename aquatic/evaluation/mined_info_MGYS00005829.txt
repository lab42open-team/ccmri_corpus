study_name	Impact of sulfamethoxazole on the microbial community of a riverine environment
study_abstract	Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health issue. The impact of sub-lethal concentrations of antibiotics on antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) spread in the environment is still unclear. In this study we used semi-realistic flume systems to mimic the riverine environment and we monitored the effect of low concentration of sulfamethoxazole on the microbial community composition and function (i.e. ARG).
