study_name	Aquifer sediment nitrate reducing community change
study_abstract	Microbial community composition change over the course of a heterotrophic nitrate reducing enrichment. Sediments used in this experiment were collected from a nitrate contaminated shallow aquifer at a depth of 58-61ft from Alda, NE. Illumina sequencing of the V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene is used.
