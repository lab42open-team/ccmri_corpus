study_name	Microbial processes in iron-rich sediments of Lake Towuti, Indonesia: Disentangling the methane and iron cycles
study_abstract	Lake Towuti is a ferruginous basin with anoxic conditions below 130 m water depth. Due to these special settings, the lake is ideal to study early diagenesis in iron-rich sediments such as those that generated ancient iron formations during the Archean and Proterozoic. We investigated microbial populations present in the sediments, their role in iron cycle and any cryptic link to other elements. For this purpose, we worked on samples from short cores that were retrieved from Lake Towuti by our scientific team from the German Research Centre for Geosciences (Potsdam, Germany) and the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). This project was supported by the ICDP priority program of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through grants to Jens Kallmeyer (KA 2293/8-1) and Aurèle Vuillemin (VU 94/1-1); the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant no. P2GEP2_148621 to Aurèle Vuillemin); the German Research Centre for Geosciences through an expedition grant to Jens Kallmeyer and Dirk Wagner; and an Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery grant (no. 0487) to Sean A. Crowe.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Ferruginous (Fe-rich, SO<sub>4</sub> -poor) conditions are generally restricted to freshwater sediments on Earth today, but were likely widespread during the Archean and Proterozoic Eons. Lake Towuti, Indonesia, is a large ferruginous lake that likely hosts geochemical processes analogous to those that operated in the ferruginous Archean ocean. The metabolic potential of microbial communities and related biogeochemical cycling under such conditions remain largely unknown. We combined geochemical measurements (pore water chemistry, sulfate reduction rates) with metagenomics to link metabolic potential with geochemical processes in the upper 50 cm of sediment. Microbial diversity and quantities of genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction (dsrAB) and methanogenesis (mcrA) decrease with increasing depth, as do rates of potential sulfate reduction. The presence of taxa affiliated with known iron- and sulfate-reducers implies potential use of ferric iron and sulfate as electron acceptors. Pore-water concentrations of acetate imply active production through fermentation. Fermentation likely provides substrates for respiration with iron and sulfate as electron donors and for methanogens that were detected throughout the core. The presence of ANME-1 16S and mcrA genes suggests potential for anaerobic methane oxidation. Overall our data suggest that microbial community metabolism in anoxic ferruginous sediments support coupled Fe, S and C biogeochemical cycling.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Extracellular DNA is ubiquitous in soil and sediment and constitutes a dominant fraction of environmental DNA in aquatic systems. In theory, extracellular DNA is composed of genomic elements persisting at different degrees of preservation produced by processes occurring on land, in the water column and sediment. Extracellular DNA can be taken up as a nutrient source, excreted or degraded by microorganisms, or adsorbed onto mineral matrices, thus potentially preserving information from past environments. To test whether extracellular DNA records lacustrine conditions, we sequentially extracted extracellular and intracellular DNA from anoxic sediments of ferruginous Lake Towuti, Indonesia. We applied 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing on both fractions to discriminate exogenous from endogenous sources of extracellular DNA in the sediment. Environmental sequences exclusively found as extracellular DNA in the sediment originated from multiple sources. For instance, <i>Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia</i>, and <i>Acidobacteria</i> derived from soils in the catchment. Limited primary productivity in the water column resulted in few sequences of <i>Cyanobacteria</i> in the oxic photic zone, whereas stratification of the water body mainly led to secondary production by aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs. <i>Chloroflexi</i> and <i>Planctomycetes</i>, the main degraders of sinking organic matter and planktonic sequences at the water-sediment interface, were preferentially preserved during the initial phase of burial. To trace endogenous sources of extracellular DNA, we used relative abundances of taxa in the intracellular DNA to define which microbial populations grow, decline or persist at low density with sediment depth. Cell lysis became an important additional source of extracellular DNA, gradually covering previous genetic assemblages as other microbial genera became more abundant with depth. The use of extracellular DNA as nutrient by active microorganisms led to selective removal of sequences with lowest GC contents. We conclude that extracellular DNA preserved in shallow lacustrine sediments reflects the initial environmental context, but is gradually modified and thereby shifts from its stratigraphic context. Discrimination of exogenous and endogenous sources of extracellular DNA allows simultaneously addressing in-lake and post-depositional processes. In deeper sediments, the accumulation of resting stages and sequences from cell lysis would require stringent extraction and specific primers if ancient DNA is targeted.
