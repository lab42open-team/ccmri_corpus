study_abstract	Our proposed microbial analyses of Guaymas Basin and Sonora Margin subsurface sediments are guided by the working hypothesis that microbial communities will change in composition and metabolic potential, as hydrothermal activity decreases across the ridge flanks, chemical and thermal gradients are attenuated, and substrate availability changes. We propose that the distinctly different lithological and hydrothermal histories of these sediments, and their depositional contexts and changing quality and quantity of buried organic matter will affect the microbial community composition and activity.PI: Andreas Teske

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The Guaymas Basin spreading center, at 2000 m depth in the Gulf of California, is overlain by a thick sedimentary cover. Across the basin, localized temperature anomalies, with active methane venting and seep fauna exist in response to magma emplacement into sediments. These sites evolve over thousands of years as magma freezes into doleritic sills and the system cools. Although several cool sites resembling cold seeps have been characterized, the hydrothermally active stage of an off-axis site was lacking good examples. Here, we present a multidisciplinary characterization of Ringvent, an ~1 km wide circular mound where hydrothermal activity persists ~28 km northwest of the spreading center. Ringvent provides a new type of intermediate-stage hydrothermal system where off-axis hydrothermal activity has attenuated since its formation, but remains evident in thermal anomalies, hydrothermal biota coexisting with seep fauna, and porewater biogeochemical signatures indicative of hydrothermal circulation. Due to their broad potential distribution, small size and limited life span, such sites are hard to find and characterize, but they provide critical missing links to understand the complex evolution of hydrothermal systems.
