study_name	a take on the impact of pollution on coastal bacterial communities
study_abstract	Coral reefs face increased environmental threats from anthropomorphic climate change and pollution, from agriculture, industries and tourism. They are economically vital for many people worldwide, and harbour a fantastically diverse ecosystem, being the home for many species of fish and algae. Surprisingly little is known about the microbial communities living in and in the surrounding of coral reefs. The objectives of this project is to characterise the community composition and function of bacteria living in the water and the upper sediment layer in close proximity of coral reefs. In this project we sequenced 3 water samples and 3 sediment samples out of the coast of Kenya, at 3 distinct location: Mombasa, Malindi and Kisite.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Coral reefs face an increased number of environmental threats from anthropomorphic climate change and pollution from agriculture, industries and sewage. Because environmental changes lead to their compositional and functional shifts, coral reef microbial communities can serve as indicators of ecosystem impacts through development of rapid and inexpensive molecular monitoring tools. Little is known about coral reef microbial communities of the Western Indian Ocean (WIO). We compared taxonomic and functional diversity of microbial communities inhabiting near-coral seawater and sediments from Kenyan reefs exposed to varying impacts of human activities. Over 19,000 species (bacterial, viral and archaeal combined) and 4,500 clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) were annotated. The coral reefs showed variations in the relative abundances of ecologically significant taxa, especially copiotrophic bacteria and coliphages, corresponding to the magnitude of the neighboring human impacts in the respective sites. Furthermore, the near-coral seawater and sediment metagenomes had an overrepresentation of COGs for functions related to adaptation to diverse environments. Malindi and Mombasa marine parks, the coral reef sites closest to densely populated settlements were significantly enriched with genes for functions suggestive of mitigation of environment perturbations including the capacity to reduce intracellular levels of environmental contaminants and repair of DNA damage. Our study is the first metagenomic assessment of WIO coral reef microbial diversity which provides a much-needed baseline for the region, and points to a potential area for future research toward establishing indicators of environmental perturbations.
