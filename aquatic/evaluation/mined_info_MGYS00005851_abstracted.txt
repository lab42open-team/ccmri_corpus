study_name	metabarcoding of eDNAbyss sediment samples
study_abstract	Sediments were collected using multicore sampler, or simple cores when a submarine or a remote operated vehicle (ROV) were present. The cores were collected and sliced according to sediment depth and using a standardized scheme. Slices were preserved and treated individually. When hard substrate was collected, the gear ELFES designed on purpose to scratch and collect the surface of substrate, or bulk samples were retained after sieving communities. Nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) were extracted and submitted to a PCR-ligation protocols using 6 sets of primers pairs targeting metazoans (2 primer pairs targeting a fragment of Cytochrome Oxydase I and one of rDNA18S V1-V2), microeukaryotes (2 primer pairs targeting rDNA 18S V4 and V9) and prokaryotes (2 sets of primer pairs targeting rDNA16S V4-V5 respectively defined for prokaryotes in general, and archaebacterial in particular).

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Seafloor sediments cover the majority of planet Earth and microorganisms inhabiting these environments play a central role in marine biogeochemical cycles. Yet, description of the biogeography and distribution of sedimentary microbial life is still too sparse to evaluate the relative contribution of processes driving this distribution, such as the levels of drift, connectivity, and specialization. To address this question, we analyzed 210 archaeal and bacterial metabarcoding libraries from a standardized and horizon-resolved collection of sediment samples from 18 stations along a longitudinal gradient from the eastern Mediterranean to the western Atlantic. Overall, we found that biogeographic patterns depended on the scale considered: while at local scale the selective influence of contemporary environmental conditions appeared strongest, the heritage of historic processes through dispersal limitation and drift became more apparent at regional scale, and ended up superseding contemporary influences at inter-regional scale. When looking at environmental factors, the structure of microbial communities was correlated primarily with water depth, with a clear transition between 800 and 1,200 meters below sea level. Oceanic basin, water temperature, and sediment depth were other important explanatory parameters of community structure. Finally, we propose increasing dispersal limitation and ecological drift with sediment depth as a probable factor for the enhanced divergence of deeper horizons communities.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Hadal trench sediments are hotspots of biogeochemical activity in the deep sea, but the biogeochemical and ecological factors that shape benthic hadal microbial communities remain unknown. Here, we sampled ten hadal sites from two trench regions with a vertical resolution of down to 1 cm. We sequenced 16S rRNA gene amplicons using universal and archaea-specific primer sets and compared the results to biogeochemical parameters. Despite bathymetric and depositional heterogeneity we found a high similarity of microbial communities within each of the two trench axes, while composition at the phylum level varied strongly with sediment depth in conjunction with the redox stratification into oxic, nitrogenous, and ferruginous zones. As a result, communities of a given sediment horizon were more similar to each other across a distance of hundreds of kilometers within each trench, than to those of adjacent horizons from the same sites separated only by centimeters. Total organic carbon content statistically only explained a small part of the variation within and between trenches, and did not explain the community differences observed between the hadal and adjacent shallower sites. Anaerobic taxa increased in abundance at the top of the ferruginous zone, seeded by organisms deposited at the sediment surface and surviving burial through the upper redox zones. While an influence of other potential factors such as geographic isolation, hydrostatic pressure, and non-steady state depositional regimes could not be discerned, redox stratification and diagenesis appear to be the main selective forces that structure community composition in hadal sediments.
