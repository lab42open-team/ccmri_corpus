study_name	Bacterial community shift in the coastal Gulf of Mexico salt-marsh sediment microcosm in vitro following exposure to the Mississippi Canyon Block 252 oil (MC252)
study_abstract	Microbial communities play a crucial role in microbial loop process that constitute the foundation of the ecosystem structure and function. The goal of this study was to monitor a shift in the bacterial community following treatment with MC252 oil.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The data in this article includes the sequences of bacterial 16S rRNA gene from metagenome of Macondo oil (MC252)-treated and non-oil-treated sediment microcosms, collected from coastal Gulf of Mexico and Bayou La Batre, USA. Metacommunity DNA was PCR amplified with 341F and 907R oligonucleotide primers, targeting V3-V5 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Data were generated by using bacterial tag-encoded FLX-amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) methodology and then processed using bioinformatics tools such as QIIME. The data information is deposited to NCBI's BioProject and BioSample and raw sequence files are available via NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database.
