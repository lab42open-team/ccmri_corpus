study_name	Multi-omics of the nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing culture BP
study_abstract	Nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing (NDFO) bacteria are widespread in the environment contribute to nitrate removal and influence the fate of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. The autotrophic growth of nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing bacteria is rarely investigated and poorly understood. The most prominent model system for this type of studies is enrichment culture KS, which originates from a freshwater sediment in Bremen, Germany. A second NDFO culture, culture BP, was obtained with a sample taken in 2015 at the same pond and cultured in a similar way. To gain insights in the metabolism of nitrate reduction coupled to iron(II) oxidation under in the absence of organic carbon and oxygen limited conditions, we performed metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analyses of culture BP.This dataset contains: (1) Raw sequencing data of 16S (V4 region, primers 515f and 806r) rRNA amplicon sequencing of the microbial community composition of the autotrophic NRFeOx enrichment culture BP and of environmental samples from the pond where culture BP originates from. Illumina MiSeq sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using PE 250 bp MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500 cycles kit) were performed at Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland). (2) Raw sequencing data of near full-length 16S (primers 27F and 1492R) sequenced with PacBio Sequel SMRT at the Helmholtz research institute, Munich, Germany. (3) Raw sequencing data of shotgun metagenomics. Library was prepared with TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Kit (Illumina) and sequenced with PE 150 bp on a NovaSeq 6000 totalling 91 Gbp by CeGaT, Tuebingen, Germany. (4) Short reads were assembled with MEGAHIT v1.2.7 using https://github.com/nf-core/mag v1.0.0. (5) Raw sequencing data of shotgun metatranscriptomes (2 conditions, triplicates). Library preparation including bacterial ribodepletion (Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus kit) and Illumina NextSeq v2.5 sequencing with PE 75 bp and 6 to 53 Mio clusters per sample were performed by Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland).

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Fe(II) oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction (NRFO) has been described for many environments. Yet very few autotrophic microorganisms catalysing NRFO have been cultivated and their diversity, as well as their mechanisms for NRFO in situ remain unclear. A novel autotrophic NRFO enrichment culture, named culture BP, was obtained from freshwater sediment. After more than 20 transfers, culture BP oxidized 8.22 mM of Fe(II) and reduced 2.42 mM of nitrate within 6.5 days under autotrophic conditions. We applied metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic analyses to culture BP to identify the microorganisms involved in autotrophic NRFO and to unravel their metabolism. Overall, twelve metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were constructed, including a dominant Gallionellaceae sp. MAG (>=71% relative abundance). Genes and transcripts associated with potential Fe(II) oxidizers in culture BP, identified as a Gallionellaceae sp., Noviherbaspirillum sp., and Thiobacillus sp., were likely involved in metal oxidation (e.g., cyc2, mtoA), denitrification (e.g., nirK/S, norBC), carbon fixation (e.g., rbcL), and oxidative phosphorylation. The putative Fe(II)-oxidizing protein Cyc2 was detected for the Gallionellaceae sp. Overall, a complex network of microbial interactions among several Fe(II) oxidizers and denitrifiers was deciphered in culture BP that might resemble NRFO mechanisms in situ. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from environmental samples revealed 36 distinct Gallionellaceae taxa, including the key player of NRFO from culture BP (approx. 0.13% relative abundance in situ). Since several of these in situ-detected Gallionellaceae taxa were closely related to the key player in culture BP, this suggests that the diversity of organisms contributing to NRFO might be higher than currently known.
