study_name	Bacterial community composition in the naturally iron-fertilized region off Kerguelen Island (Southern Ocean). Targeted Locus (Loci)
study_abstract	The KEOPS2 cruise sampling strategy covered spatially diverse iron-fertilized stations at early bloom stages in the Kerguelen plateau and ocean region (Oct-Nov 2011). KEOPS2 data showed that natural iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean at the scale of hundreds of thousands km2 produced a mosaic of blooms, and that the biological and biogeochemical response to fertilization was diverse. The objective of this study was to explore the bacterial community structure using 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing during the onset of spring phytoplankton blooms in the context of natural Fe fertilization of the Southern Ocean.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Marine microbes have a pivotal role in the marine biogeochemical cycle of carbon, because they regulate the turnover of dissolved organic matter (DOM), one of the largest carbon reservoirs on Earth. Microbial communities and DOM are both highly diverse components of the ocean system, yet the role of microbial diversity for carbon processing remains thus far poorly understood. We report here results from an exploration of a mosaic of phytoplankton blooms induced by large-scale natural iron fertilization in the Southern Ocean. We show that in this unique ecosystem where concentrations of DOM are lowest in the global ocean, a patchwork of blooms is associated with diverse and distinct bacterial communities. By using on-board continuous cultures, we identify preferences in the degradation of DOM of different reactivity for taxa associated with contrasting blooms. We used the spatial and temporal variability provided by this natural laboratory to demonstrate that the magnitude of bacterial production is linked to the extent of compositional changes. Our results suggest that partitioning of the DOM resource could be a mechanism that structures bacterial communities with a positive feedback on carbon cycling. Our study, focused on bacterial carbon processing, highlights the potential role of diversity as a driving force for the cycling of biogeochemical elements.
