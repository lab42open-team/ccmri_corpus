study_name	Methanogens and iron-reducing bacteria are major contributors to mercury methylation in boreal lake sediments
study_abstract	Methylmercury is a potent human neurotoxin easily biomagnified in aquatic food webs. Anaerobic microorganisms containing the hgcA gene potentially mediate the formation of methylmercury in natural environments, but the diversity of microbial mercury methylating communities in the environment remains largely unexplored. The diversity of mercury methylating microbial communities in boreal lake sediments, encompassing a wide range of mercury methylation rates, was characterized using barcoded amplification and high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and hgcA genes. Previously, most studies in aquatic ecosystems have implicated sulphate-reducing bacteria as the main mercury methylators. Here we demonstrate that Methanomicrobiales contribute significantly to the hgcA gene pool in boreal lake sediments. Experimental mercury isotope tracer incubations confirmed that, while sulphate-reducers contribute to mercury methylation, methanogens and iron reducers are also quantitatively important for the process. Our results change the way we perceive the local and global diversity of mercury methylating microbial communities in boreal lake sediments and call for further studies on the environmental factors regulating mercury methylation.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Methylmercury is a potent human neurotoxin which biomagnifies in aquatic food webs. Although anaerobic microorganisms containing the <i>hgcA</i> gene potentially mediate the formation of methylmercury in natural environments, the diversity of these mercury-methylating microbial communities remains largely unexplored. Previous studies have implicated sulfate-reducing bacteria as the main mercury methylators in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, we characterized the diversity of mercury-methylating microbial communities of boreal lake sediments using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and <i>hgcA</i> genes. Our results show that in the lake sediments, <i>Methanomicrobiales</i> and <i>Geobacteraceae</i> also represent abundant members of the mercury-methylating communities. In fact, incubation experiments with a mercury isotopic tracer and molybdate revealed that only between 38% and 45% of mercury methylation was attributed to sulfate reduction. These results suggest that methanogens and iron-reducing bacteria may contribute to more than half of the mercury methylation in boreal lakes.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Despite the global awareness that mercury, and methylmercury in particular, is a neurotoxin to which millions of people continue to be exposed, there are sizable gaps in the understanding of the processes and organisms involved in methylmercury formation in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, we shed light on the diversity of the microorganisms responsible for methylmercury formation in boreal lake sediments. All the microorganisms identified are associated with the processing of organic matter in aquatic systems. Moreover, our results show that the well-known mercury-methylating sulfate-reducing bacteria constituted only a minor portion of the potential mercury methylators. In contrast, methanogens and iron-reducing bacteria were important contributors to methylmercury formation, highlighting their role in mercury cycling in the environment.
