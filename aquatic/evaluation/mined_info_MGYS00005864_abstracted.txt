study_name	Comparisons of microbial diversity over time in two different pH conditions in a geoduck hatchery.
study_abstract	For years, hatcheries in Washington (USA) and elsewhere have experienced unexplained mass mortality events in which entire cohorts of larvae do not survive through setting (transition from mobile larval to sessile juvenile phase). Investigations into known diseases, genetics, and water quality, among other factors, yield no direct correlations to these mortality events. Therefore, it has been proposed that more subtle shifts in the microbiome and/or water quality may be causing larval mortality. A full characterization of the resident microbial community (microbiome) in a hatchery could provide insight into the baseline microbiome and deviations from the baseline that may contribute to mortality events.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Microbial communities are ubiquitous throughout ecosystems and are commensal with hosts across taxonomic boundaries. Environmental and species-specific microbiomes are instrumental in maintaining ecosystem and host health, respectively. The introduction of pathogenic microbes that shift microbiome community structure can lead to illness and death. Understanding the dynamics of microbiomes across a diversity of environments and hosts will help us to better understand which taxa forecast survival and which forecast mortality events. We characterized the bacterial community microbiome in the water of a commercial shellfish hatchery in Washington state, USA, where the hatchery has been plagued by recurring and unexplained larval mortality events. By applying the complementary methods of metagenomics and metaproteomics we were able to more fully characterize the bacterial taxa in the hatchery at high (pH 8.2) and low (pH 7.1) pH that were metabolically active versus present but not contributing metabolically. There were shifts in the taxonomy and functional profile of the microbiome between pH and over time. Based on detected metagenomic reads and metaproteomic peptide spectral matches, some taxa were more metabolically active than expected based on presence alone (Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria) and some were less metabolically active than expected (e.g., Betaproteobacteria, Cytophagia). There was little correlation between potential and realized metabolic function based on Gene Ontology analysis of detected genes and peptides. The complementary methods of metagenomics and metaproteomics contribute to a more full characterization of bacterial taxa that are potentially active versus truly metabolically active and thus impact water quality and inter-trophic relationships.
