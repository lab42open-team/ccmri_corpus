study_name	Biodiversity and Functional Patterns of Microbial Assemblages in Postglacial Pond Sediment Profiles
study_abstract	The purpose of this project is to characterize biodiversity and functional patterns of microbial assemblages in sediment profiles of postglacial ponds that have experienced different histories of human land-use change, and to compare these patterns with a suite of temporal, biological and geochemical markers.
