publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The marine diatom <i>Guinardia delicatula</i> is a cosmopolitan species that dominates seasonal blooms in the English Channel and the North Sea. Several eukaryotic parasites are known to induce the mortality of this species. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of the first viruses that infect <i>G</i>. <i>delicatula</i>. Viruses were isolated from the Western English Channel (SOMLIT-Astan station) during the late summer bloom decline of <i>G</i>. <i>delicatula</i>. A combination of laboratory approaches revealed that these lytic viruses (GdelRNAV) are small tailless particles of 35-38 nm in diameter that replicate in the host cytoplasm where both unordered particles and crystalline arrays are formed. GdelRNAV display a linear single-stranded RNA genome of ~9 kb, including two open reading frames encoding for replication and structural polyproteins. Phylogenetic relationships based on the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase gene marker showed that GdelRNAV are new members of the <i>Bacillarnavirus</i>, a monophyletic genus belonging to the order <i>Picornavirales</i>. GdelRNAV are specific to several strains of <i>G</i>. <i>delicatula</i>. They were rapidly and largely produced (&lt;12 h, 9.34 x 10<sup>4</sup> virions per host cell). Our analysis points out the host's variable viral susceptibilities during the early exponential growth phase. Interestingly, we consistently failed to isolate viruses during spring and early summer while <i>G</i>. <i>delicatula</i> developed important blooms. While our study suggests that viruses do contribute to the decline of <i>G</i>. <i>delicatula</i>'s late summer bloom, they may not be the primary mortality agents during the remaining blooms at SOMLIT-Astan. Future studies should focus on the relative contribution of the viral and eukaryotic pathogens to the control of <i>Guinardia</i>'s blooms to understand the fate of these prominent organisms in marine systems.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Viruses in the order Picornavirales infect eukaryotes, and are widely distributed in coastal waters. Amplicon deep-sequencing of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) revealed diverse and highly uneven communities of picorna-like viruses in the coastal waters of British Columbia (BC), Canada. Almost 300 000 pyrosequence reads revealed 145 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on 95% sequence similarity at the amino-acid level. Each sample had between 24 and 71 OTUs and there was little overlap among samples. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that some clades of OTUs were only found at one site; whereas, other clades included OTUs from all sites. Since most of these OTUs are likely from viruses that infect eukaryotic phytoplankton, and viral isolates infecting phytoplankton are strain-specific; each OTU probably arose from the lysis of a specific phytoplankton taxon. Moreover, the patchiness in OTU distribution, and the high turnover of viruses in the mixed layer, implies continuous infection and lysis by RNA viruses of a diverse array of eukaryotic phytoplankton taxa. Hence, these viruses are likely important elements structuring the phytoplankton community, and play a significant role in nutrient cycling and energy transfer.
