study_abstract	The goal of this project is to examine and integrate taxonomic, genetic, and functional diversity in marine lakes in Palau and Indonesia. Samples have been collected at multiple depths in multiple lakes since 2010. DNA was extracted from filtered water samples, and archaeal/bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified and then sequenced (using 454 in 2010 and Illumina thereafter).
