study_name	Bio-GO-SHIP: Global marine 'omics studies of repeat hydrography transects
study_abstract	The Global Ocean Shipboard Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP) is a ship-based global survey of ocean hydrographic sections, which are repeatedly measured on a decadal time scale. The program covers a suite of physical (light, heat, currents, water column structure, etc.) and chemical (nutrients, oxygen, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, pH, etc.) state variables over the full ocean water column, and in areas of the ocean inaccessible to other platforms. The principal scientific objectives for GO-SHIP are: (1) understanding and documenting the large-scale ocean water property distributions, their changes, and drivers of those changes, and (2) addressing questions of how a future ocean will increase in dissolved inorganic carbon, become more acidified and more stratified, and experience changes in circulation and ventilation processes due to global warming and altered water cycle.The vision of the biological GO-SHIP initiative, or "Bio-GO-SHIP," is to develop a deep understanding of the link between the physio-chemical environment and global ocean plankton diversity, abundance, and biogeochemical roles in the context of a changing ocean. This will be achieved through systematic, high-quality, and calibrated sampling of marine 'omics products.In this BioProject, we aim to provide a singular resource for Bio-GO-SHIP 'omics datasets. We also provide appropriate metadata such that the 'omics data may be linked to the broad range of state variables measured by GO-SHIP and associated oceanographic transects.
