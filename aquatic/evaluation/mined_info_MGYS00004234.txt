study_name	Eukaryote diversity assessment of sediments of the Western English Channel
study_abstract	Sediments were collected at monthly intervals from the Western English Channel (site L4) and environmental DNA extracted. The effect of season on the community composition and diversity of eukaryotes was assessed using in depth sequencing of 18S rRNA genes. This data will be compared with traditional techniques used to identify benthic species to assess the efficacy of eDNA biomonitoring as a tool for measuring biodiversity.
