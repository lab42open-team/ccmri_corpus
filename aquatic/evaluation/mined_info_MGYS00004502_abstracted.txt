publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Parsing the relative importance of environmental (recent disturbances) and spatial factors (historical processes) in determining community structure is a core issue in ecology. The Bohai Bay is a typical semi-enclosed bay located in the north of China, surrounding by the metropolitan area with anthropogenic disturbances made it a complex marine coastal system with pollution gradients, where the distributions and determinants of bacterioplankton communities remain unclear. In this study, we collected surface water samples from 19 sites across Bohai Bay at about 100 km scale to investigate the relative roles of local environments and regional spatial factors in shaping bacterioplankton community composition (BCC). The environmental parameters in the sampling region showed gradient change according to the geographic variation. Several abundant OTUs were significantly correlated with the pollution parameters in the studied area, and 16 OTUs of them showed distinct distribution pattern in different polluted regions with obvious geographic segmentation, which indicated the effects of pollution gradient and dispersal limitation on specific taxon. The BCCs did not show obviously clustering effect between different polluted regions, which indicated the complexity for explaining the BCC variation in the studied region. The partial Mantel test revealed stronger spatial effects on beta diversity than those of local environmental factors, which indicated that dispersal limitation accounted more for the beta diversity than environmental heterogeneity. Furthermore, variation partitioning analysis (VPA) conducted by combining the environmental variables, linear trends, and principal coordinates of the variables from neighbor matrices (PCNM) showed that it was the joint effects of environmental and spatial factors contributed to the explained variation of BCC in the studied area. Considering the special human geography characteristics of Bohai Bay, the unmeasured biotic/abiotic factors, stochastic factors, and anthropogenic disturbances may be responsible for the unexplained variation of the BCC.
