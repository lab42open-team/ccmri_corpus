study_name	EMG produced TPA metagenomics assembly of PRJNA247822 data set (Ecological Genomics of a Seasonally Anoxic Fjord; Saanich Inlet).
study_abstract	The Third Party Annotation (TPA) assembly was derived from the primary whole genome shotgun (WGS) data set PRJNA247822, and was assembled with SPAdes v3.14.1, metaSPAdes v3.14.1. This project includes samples from the following biomes: root:Environmental:Aquatic:Marine:Intertidal zone:Estuary.
