study_name	Analyses of biofilms in drainage water during the construction phase of the Koralm railway tunnel
study_abstract	During the construction phase of the Koralm railway tunnel several samples from different sites were analysed for the presence of microbes. 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and subsequent microbial profiling revealed the presence of bacterial consortia typical for the deep continental subsurface dominated by autotrophs, methanotrophs and methylotrophs.
