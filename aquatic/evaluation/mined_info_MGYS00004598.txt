study_name	Diversity of methyl alkyl succinate synthase genes in hydrocarbon seep sediments (Raw sequence reads)
study_abstract	In this study, the potential of hydrocarbon biodegradation in marine sediments was determined through the detection of a functional biomarker, the masD gene encoding (1-methyl-alkyl) succinate synthase, the key enzyme of anaerobic alkane degradation. We studied the masD diversity in 12 sampling sites from 7 methane, gas and hydrocarbon seeps differing in water depth, sediment depth, temperature, sulfate reduction rate and hydrocarbon composition (alkanes, aromatics) by parallel 454-tagged sequencing.
