study_abstract	Marine DNA/RNA samples from Western English Channel site L4. The seasonal structure of microbial communities in the Western English Channel - 2007 Here we present a multi-omic study of the Bacterial and Archaeal diversity found at the L4 long-term marine observatory. We have previously generated a six year time series from L4 that showed that the bacterial community shows strong seasonal structuring and diversity peaks every year on the winter solstice. Here we further confirm this pattern by extending this study to include genes and transcripts generated for eight additional time points in 2008. This data includes further 16S datasets as well as eight metagenomes (1.2GB) and eight metatranscriptomes (157MB). These time points cover three seasons (Jan, April and August) and include day and night (diel) samples. In addition, the August samples (4) include 4 consecutive samplings within 24 hours at six hour intervals. Using these data we test whether Archaea also show the same observed seasonal patterns and whether these patterns hold true at the gene (functional) level. Analysis of this combined data set allows five main conclusions to be drawn. First, Archaea show evidence of following the same seasonal patterns as Bacteria, but have ~6% the richness. Second, for both Bacteria and Archaea, we confirm that higher 16S diversity reflects higher diversity at the gene-level (including expressed genes) and this diversity also peaks at the winter solstice. Third, interestingly, detectable diversity appears to be higher at night, and this is of special potential relevance as there is more diversity in winter when nights are longer. Fourth, despite the diversity of these communities, night and day samples taken using Lagrangian (drift) sampling were successful in isolating the same community suggesting communities are more structured than is commonly believed. Finally, this data, as expected, contains a large proportion of orphan genes without known homologues. When compared to the housekeeping genes identified through SEED subsystem classification, these unknown genes appear to be driving the differences between samples across seasons. This underscores the importance of determining the functions of more of these sequences in the future. In summary, this study further confirms the strong seasonal patterns characterizing both the bacterial and archaeal communities at this important marine site. The finding that, despite the huge diversity of these communities, there are evident signs of predictable patterns and detectable stability over time provides compelling evidence that renewed efforts should

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Very few marine microbial communities are well characterized even with the weight of research effort presently devoted to it. Only a small proportion of this effort has been aimed at investigating temporal community structure. Here we present the first report of the application of high-throughput pyrosequencing to investigate intra-annual bacterial community structure. Microbial diversity was determined for 12 time points at the surface of the L4 sampling site in the Western English Channel. This was performed over 11 months during 2007. A total of 182 560 sequences from the V6 hyper-variable region of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA) were obtained; there were between 11 327 and 17 339 reads per sample. Approximately 7000 genera were identified, with one in every 25 reads being attributed to a new genus; yet this level of sampling far from exhausted the total diversity present at any one time point. The total data set contained 17 673 unique sequences. Only 93 (0.5%) were found at all time points, yet these few lineages comprised 50% of the total reads sequenced. The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria (50% of all sequenced reads), while the SAR11 clade comprised 21% of the ubiquitous reads and approximately 12% of the total sequenced reads. In contrast, 78% of all operational taxonomic units were only found at one time point and 67% were only found once, evidence of a large and transient rare assemblage. This time series shows evidence of seasonally structured community diversity. There is also evidence for seasonal succession, primarily reflecting changes among dominant taxa. These changes in structure were significantly correlated to a combination of temperature, phosphate and silicate concentrations.
