study_abstract	Surface global ocean prokaryotic picoplankton from the Malaspina-2010 expedition: Surface waters (3m depth) from a total of 122 globally-distributed stations located in the tropical and sub-tropical global ocean were sampled from December 2010 to July 2011 as part of the Malaspina-2010 expedition (Duarte 2015). Water samples were obtained with Niskin bottles attached to a CTD profiler that included sensors for conductivity, temperature, oxygen, fluorescence and turbidity. About 12L of seawater were sequentially filtered through a 20m nylon mesh, followed by a 3m and 0.2m polycarbonate filters of 47mm diameter. Only the picoplankton size-fraction (0.2-3 m) was used for sequencing. DNA was extracted using a standard phenol-chloroform protocol (Massana, et al. 1997). The V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with the primers 515F-Y (5'-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (5'-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT) (Parada et al. 2016) and sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq platform (2x250bp) at the Research and Testing Laboratory (Lubbock, Texas, USA; http://www.researchandtesting.com).

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Microbial taxa range from being ubiquitous and abundant across space to extremely rare and endemic, depending on their ecophysiology and on different processes acting locally or regionally. However, little is known about how cosmopolitan or rare taxa combine to constitute communities and whether environmental variations promote changes in their relative abundances. Here we identified the Spatial Abundance Distribution (SpAD) of individual prokaryotic taxa (16S rDNA-defined Operational Taxonomic Units, OTUs) across 108 globally-distributed surface ocean stations. We grouped taxa based on their SpAD shape ("normal-like"- abundant and ubiquitous; "logistic"- globally rare, present in few sites; and "bimodal"- abundant only in certain oceanic regions), and investigated how the abundance of these three categories relates to environmental gradients. Most surface assemblages were numerically dominated by a few cosmopolitan "normal-like" OTUs, yet there was a gradual shift towards assemblages dominated by "logistic" taxa in specific areas with productivity and temperature differing the most from the average conditions in the sampled stations. When we performed the SpAD categorization including additional habitats (deeper layers and particles of varying sizes), the SpAD of many OTUs changed towards fewer "normal-like" shapes, and OTUs categorized as globally rare in the surface ocean became abundant. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms behind microbial rarity and dominance requires expanding the context of study beyond local communities and single habitats. We show that marine bacterial communities comprise taxa displaying a continuum of SpADs, and that variations in their abundances can be linked to habitat transitions or barriers that delimit the distribution of community members.
