study_name	Fungal communities across four coastal marine habitats in North Carolina, USA
study_abstract	Despite nearly a century of study, the diversity of marine fungi remains poorly understood. Historical surveys utilizing microscopy or culture-dependent methods suggest that marine fungi are relatively species-poor, predominantly Dikarya, and localized to coastal habitats. However, the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies to characterize microbial communities has challenged traditional concepts of fungal diversity by revealing novel phylotypes from both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Here, I used ion semiconductor sequencing (Ion Torrent) of the ribosomal large subunit (LSU/28S) to explore fungal diversity from water and sediment samples collected from four habitats in coastal North Carolina. The dominant taxa observed were Ascomycota and Chytridiomycota, though all fungal phyla were represented. Diversity was highest in sand flats and wetland sediments, though benthic sediments harbored the highest proportion of novel sequences. Most sequences assigned to early-diverging fungal groups could not be assigned beyond phylum with statistical support, suggesting they belong to unknown lineages.
