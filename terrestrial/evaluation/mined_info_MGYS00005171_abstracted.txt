study_name	Soil bacterial diversity is associated with human population density in urban greenspaces
study_abstract	Urban greenspaces form a vital part of the urban ecosystem and provide an extensive array of ecosystem services, including pollutant degradation, water management, carbon maintenance, and nutrient cycling. However, while the soil microbiota in these ecosystems are essential to these services they remain under-characterized. Here we aimed to determine whether turf grass soil bacterial communities were associated with human population density across a range of greenspaces in parks, streets, and residential areas across a major urban area. Results showed that bacterial diversity was significantly positively correlated with population density within the immediate vicinity of the sampled areas; and species diversity was greater in park and street soils, when compared with residential zones. Population density and greenspace type (park vs street vs residential area) also associated with the composition and structure of the bacterial community. Edaphic properties, including pH, moisture and texture, were also significantly correlated with microbial composition and structure. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that microbial guilds in urban soils were well connected. Soil moisture and texture together with population density and greenspace type showed strong correlations with several network topological features including assortativity degree, edge density, average path, average betweenness and closeness. These results indicate that changes in urban demographics, as well as the changes in land-use may influence the diversity and structure of urban soil microbial communities. As urbanization is rapidly growing across the planet, understanding the consequences of different urban zoning on soil microbiota represents an unmet need.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Urban greenspaces provide extensive ecosystem services, including pollutant remediation, water management, carbon maintenance, and nutrient cycling. However, while the urban soil microbiota underpin these services, we still have limited understanding of the factors that influence their distribution. We characterized soil bacterial communities from turf-grasses associated with urban parks, streets, and residential sites across a major urban environment, including a gradient of human population density. Bacterial diversity was significantly positively correlated with the population density; and species diversity was greater in park and street soils, compared to residential soils. Population density and greenspace type also led to significant differences in the microbial community composition that was also significantly correlated with soil pH, moisture, and texture. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that microbial guilds in urban soils were well correlated. Abundant soil microbes in high density population areas had fewer interactions, while abundant bacteria in high moisture soils had more interactions. These results indicate the significant influence of changes in urban demographics and land-use on soil microbial communities. As urbanization is rapidly growing across the planet, it is important to improve our understanding of the consequences of urban zoning on the soil microbiota.
