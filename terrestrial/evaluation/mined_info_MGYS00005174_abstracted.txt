study_abstract	This study focuses on the influence of tree species composition, soil properties and seasonality on the structure of soil bacterial communities by employing high-throughput sequencing of the 16SrRNA gene. Soil cores were collected from bulk soil (0 - 5 cm depth) within eight tree clusters containing mono-species (beech, horn, lime and oak) and mixed-species (BOH, BOL, BHL and OHL) stands during Spring, Summer and Autumn 2012.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Amplicon-based analysis of 16S rRNA genes and transcripts was used to assess the effect of tree species composition on soil bacterial community structure and function in a temperate deciduous forest. Samples were collected from mono and mixed stands of <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (beech), <i>Carpinus betulus</i> (hornbeam), <i>Tilia</i> sp. (lime), and <i>Quercus</i> sp. (oak) in spring, summer, and autumn. Soil bacterial community exhibited similar taxonomic composition at total (DNA-based) and potentially active community (RNA-based) level, with fewer taxa present at active community level. Members of <i>Rhizobiales</i> dominated at both total and active bacterial community level, followed by members of <i>Acidobacteriales, Solibacterales</i>, <i>Rhodospirillales</i>, and <i>Xanthomonadales</i>. Bacterial communities at total and active community level showed a significant positive correlation with tree species identity (mono stands) and to a lesser extent with tree species richness (mixed stands). Approximately 58 and 64% of indicator operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed significant association with only one mono stand at total and active community level, respectively, indicating a strong impact of tree species on soil bacterial community composition. Soil C/N ratio, pH, and P content similarly exhibited a significant positive correlation with soil bacterial communities, which was attributed to direct and indirect effects of forest stands. Seasonality was the strongest driver of predicted metabolic functions related to C fixation and degradation, and N metabolism. Carbon and nitrogen metabolic processes were significantly abundant in spring, while C degradation gene abundances increased from summer to autumn, corresponding to increased litterfall and decomposition. The results revealed that in a spatially homogenous forest soil, tree species diversity and richness are dominant drivers of structure and composition in soil bacterial communities.
