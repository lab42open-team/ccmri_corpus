study_abstract	In this study, the effect of deforestation and cultivation of maize (Zea mays L.) on the physicochemical characteristics and the bacterial community structure in soil were studied at the national park Nevado de Toluca in Mexico. Soil was sampled from three forested areas in the national park with natural vegetation, and from three deforested areas cultivated with maize or grazed by animals and characterized while the bacterial community structure was investigated through 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Land-use change is one of the most important drivers of change in biodiversity. Deforestation for grazing or agriculture has transformed large areas of temperate forest in the central highlands of Mexico, but its impact on soil fungal communities is still largely unknown. In this study, we determined how deforestation of a high-altitude temperate forest for cultivation of maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.) or husbandry altered the taxonomic, phylogenetic, functional, and beta diversity of soil fungal communities using a 18S rRNA metabarcoding analysis. The true taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity at order <i>q</i> = 1, i.e., considering frequent operational taxonomic units, decreased significantly in the arable, but not in the pasture soil. The beta diversity decreased in the order forest &gt; pasture &gt; arable soil. The ordination analysis showed a clear effect of intensity of land-use as the forest soil clustered closer to pasture than to the arable soil. The most abundant fungal phyla in the studied soils were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mucoromycota. Deforestation more than halved the relative abundance of Basidiomycota; mostly Agaricomycetes, such as <i>Lactarius</i> and <i>Inocybe</i>. The relative abundance of Glomeromycota decreased in the order pasture &gt; forest &gt; arable soil. Symbiotrophs, especially ectomycorrhizal fungi, were negatively affected by deforestation while pathotrophs, especially animal pathogens, were enriched in the pasture and arable soil. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were more abundant in the forest soil as they are usually associated with conifers. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were more abundant in the pasture than in the arable soil as the higher plant diversity provided more suitable hosts. Changes in fungal communities resulting from land-use change can provide important information for soil management and the assessment of the environmental impact of deforestation and conversion of vulnerable ecosystems such as high-altitude temperate forests.
