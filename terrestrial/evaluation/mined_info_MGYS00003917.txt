study_name	Agricultural intensification and the functional capacity of soil microbes on smallholder African farms - kakamenga
study_abstract	For the previous 2-3 years, soils from a chronosequence of farms along the edge of the Kakamega forest in Kenya along with soils from adjacent forested plots were sampled for trace gas fluxes and nitrogen cycling processes. This project sampled soils from the same plots to evaluate the effects of land use change and farm age on the bacteria responsible for key nitrogen cycling processes.
