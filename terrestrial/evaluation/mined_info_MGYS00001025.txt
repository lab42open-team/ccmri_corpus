study_abstract	To investigate post-fire changes in soil AMF community structure and diversity. Our work was aimed at studying the short- and long-term response of the AMF communities, so sampling was performed at sites were fires had burned 1 or 11 years prior and compared to nearby unburned control sites. To achieve the purpose, we want to evaluate (i) how soil AMF communities respond to short- and long-term effect of wildfire, and (ii) which factors affect AMF communities and whether there are thresholds for factors driving AMF communities.
