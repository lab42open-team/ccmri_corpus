study_name	Becker field soil DNA Metagenome
study_abstract	Five Streptomyces isolates and their combination plus a non-inoculated control was inoculated into field for the biocontrol of potato scab disease. Soil samples from each pot were collected pre-planting and in mid-season. the DNA sequences from each soil samples were extracted and amplified in order to understand the construction of soil microbial community during biocontrol and the influences of indigenous microbial community on biocontrol results.
