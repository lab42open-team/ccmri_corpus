study_name	Bacterial diversity and community composition in grassland and forest soils of the German Biodiversity Exploratories
study_abstract	Bacterial diversity and community composition should be assessed for grassland and forest soils in the three German Biodiversity Exploratories (Schorfheide-Chorin, Hainich-Dun, Schwabische Alb). Grassland soil samples were derived from meadows, pastures or mown pastures that were either fertilized or non-fertilized. Forest soil samples were derived from age class forest, selection forest or natural forest and dominated by either beech, oak, pine or spruce trees.The study focused on the effect of land use, management, fertilization and tree species as well as edaphic parameters onto the bacterial community and diversity to identify drivers of diversity and community composition.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Soil bacteria provide a large range of ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling. Despite their important role in soil systems, compositional and functional responses of bacterial communities to different land use and management regimes are not fully understood. Here, we assessed soil bacterial communities in 150 forest and 150 grassland soils derived from three German regions by pyrotag sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Land use type (forest and grassland) and soil edaphic properties strongly affected bacterial community structure and function, whereas management regime had a minor effect. In addition, a separation of soil bacterial communities by sampling region was encountered. Soil pH was the best predictor for bacterial community structure, diversity and function. The application of multinomial log-linear models revealed distinct responses of abundant bacterial groups towards pH. Predicted functional profiles revealed that differences in land use not only select for distinct bacterial populations but also for specific functional traits. The combination of 16S rRNA data and corresponding functional profiles provided comprehensive insights into compositional and functional adaptations to changing environmental conditions associated with differences in land use and management.
