study_name	Diversity of microbial community (bacteria, micro-eukaryotes and fungi) in the Passage of Lascaux Cave.
study_abstract	In the Passage of Lascaux Cave (France), the potential effect of season, mineral substrate and presence of stains was tested on present (DNA) and active (RNA) microbial community with high-throughput sequencing.Three genes markers of microbial diversity were analyzed, the 16S rRNA genes specific for bacteria, the 18S rRNA genes specific for micro-eukaryotes and the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) specific for fungi. Sequences corresponding to active microbial community were named with c.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The World-famous UNESCO heritage from the Paleolithic human society, Lascaux Cave (France), has endeavored intense microclimatic perturbations, in part due to high touristic pressure. These perturbations have resulted in numerous disturbances of the cave ecosystem, including on its microbial compartment, which resulted in the formation of black stains especially on the rock faces of the passage. We investigated the cave microbiome in this part of Lascaux by sampling three mineral substrates (soil, banks, and inclined planes) on and outside stains to assess current cave microbial assemblage and explore the possibility that pigmented microorganisms involved in stain development occur as microbial consortia. Microbial abundance and diversity were assessed by means of quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of several DNA and cDNA taxonomic markers. Five sampling campaigns were carried out during winter and summer to embrace potential seasonal effect in this somewhat stable environment (based on measurements of temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration). While the season or type of mineral substrate did not affect the abundances of bacteria and micro-eukaryotes on or outside stains, mineral substrate rather than stain presence appears to be the most significant factor determining microbial diversity and structuring microbial community, regardless of whether DNA or cDNA markers were considered. A phylogenetic signal was also detected in relation to substrate types, presence of stains but not with season among the OTUs common to the three substrates. Co-occurrence network analyses showed that most bacterial and fungal interactions were positive regardless of the factor tested (season, substrate, or stain), but these networks varied according to ecological conditions and time. Microorganisms known to harbor pigmentation ability were well established inside but also outside black stains, which may be prerequisite for subsequent stain formation. This first high throughput sequencing performed in Lascaux Cave showed that black stains were secondary to mineral substrate in determining microbiome community structure, regardless of whether total or transcriptionally active bacterial and micro-eukaryotic communities were considered. These results revealed the potential for new stain formation and highlight the need for careful microbiome management to avoid further cave wall degradation.
