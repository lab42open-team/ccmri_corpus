study_abstract	High-throughput pyrosequencing analysis of amplified 16S rRNA genes from soil samples from the most prominent plant communities and soil types collected in ice-free areas of Keller Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica. The Antarctic soil metagenome is part of a larger project from the National Institutes of Science and Technology - Antarctic Environmental Research (abbreviated as INCT-APA in Brazilian Portuguese). The Institute was created by the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology (Minist rio de Ci ncia e Tecnologia (MCT) in search of excellence in scientific activities at an international level in strategic areas defined by the Action Plan 2007-2010 of the Science Programme, Technology and Innovation for Antarctica, by means of programmes and instruments made operational by CNPq and by FAPERJ (Research support Foundations at different levels). The referred initiative has the view to implement a network of atmospheric, oceanic and cryospheric monitoring, in the Antarctic region. More details about the Institute and its objectives can be found at http://www.biologia.ufrj.br/inct-antartico/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/APA.pdf Specifically, the Antarctic metagenome project aims to obtain a detailed baseline description of the soil bacterial communities found in the Antarctic soils against which to compare changes in the Antarctic microbiome caused by climate changes or human activities. In addition, using Antarctica as a simple ecosystem model with low or no human influence, to determine the major factors responsible for the overall patterns of soil microbial diversity in Antarctica.
