study_name	Soil bacteria Metagenome
study_abstract	The study focused on determining bacterial diversity in soil that has been under (1) continuous no-tillage and (2) continuous plow-tillage for five decades. Soil bacterial diversity under a long-term soil management practice is relevant since it provides clues about the effect of long-term agricultural management practices on soil microbial environment.
