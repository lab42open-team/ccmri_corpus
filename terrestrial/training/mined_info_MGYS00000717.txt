study_abstract	This research, by means of 454 pyrosequencing, determined the effects of 1,3-D on the bacterial community. The results of this study will evaluate the effects of 1,3-D on the soil bacterial community of greenhouse vegetable industry and offer a theoretical foundation to the use of 1,3-D on greenhouse vegetable industry. These soil samples were collected in in a commercial field near Fang county, Taian City, Shandong province, China. The soil at the experimental site was a silt loam, composed of 15% sand, 80% silt, and 5% clay, with an organic matter content of 24.8 g kg-1 of soil, pH 7.2, and a soil density of 1.21 g cm-3
