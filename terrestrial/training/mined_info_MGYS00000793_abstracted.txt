study_abstract	The overall aims of this study were (1) to explore soil bacterial communities in four typical temperate forest types from Changbai Mountain (Broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest, Secondary poplar-birch forest, Spruce-fir forest, and Larch forest) with newly developed bar-coded 454 pyrosequencing method; (2) to elucidate the biotic and abiotic factors controlling the abundance, diversity and composition of soil bacterial communities; (3) to test if the differentiation of soil bacterial communities in these temperate forests support the copiotroph/oligotroph functional classification model and the non-random co-occurrence patterns. This study will provide the first glimpse at the potential role of above-ground vegetation in allowing niche differentiation of soil bacterial communities in natural temperate forests situated in Changbai Mountain, and tries to reveal the intrinsic mechanism of such differentiation.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Understanding ecological linkages between above- and below-ground biota is critical for deepening our knowledge on the maintenance and stability of ecosystem processes. Nevertheless, direct comparisons of plant-microbe diversity at the community level remain scarce due to the knowledge gap between microbial ecology and plant ecology. We compared the Alfa- and Beta- diversities of plant and soil bacterial communities in two temperate forests that represented early and late successional stages. We documented different patterns of aboveground-belowground diversity relationships in these forests. We observed no linkage between plant and bacterial Alfa-diversity in the early successional forest, and even a negative correlation in the late successional forest, indicating that high bacterial Alfa-diversity is not always linked to high plant Alfa-diversity. Beta-diversity coupling was only found at the late successional stage, while in the early successional forest, the bacterial Beta-diversity was closely correlated with soil property distances. Additionally, we showed that the dominant competitive tree species in the late successional forest may play key roles in driving forest succession by shaping the soil bacterial community in the early successional stage. This study sheds new light on the potential aboveground-belowground linkage in natural ecosystems, which may help us understand the mechanisms that drive ecosystem succession.
