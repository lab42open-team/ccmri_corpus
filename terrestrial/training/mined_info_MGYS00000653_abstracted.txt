study_name	Metatranscriptomic Analysis for Eukaryotic Functional Genes in Forest Soil
study_abstract	For the extraction of environmental RNA after enrichment with wheat bran and avicel, the sample was collected from the forest humic soil in the site of AIST. A forest soil in the site of AIST Tsukuba, Japan (36.06N 140.17E). The extraction of total RNA and the purification of polyadenylated eukaryotic mRNA from the enriched soil sample were used to commercially available kit, respectively. The synthesized cDNA sample from the purified mRNA was outsourced to Dragon Genomics Center for 454 GS FLX sequencing. The aim of this study is the exploration of the novel eukaryotic functional genes from an environmental sample using metatranscriptomic approach. This method is widely applicable to the provision of novel eukaryotic enzymes and proteins of potential industrial or medical use.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	To discover the structural and functional novel glycoside hydrolase enzymes from soil fungal communities that decompose cellulosic biomass, transcripts of functional genes in a forest soil were analyzed. Pyrosequencing of the Avicel and wheat-amended soil cDNAs produced 56,084 putative protein-coding sequence (CDS) fragments, and the most dominant group of putative CDSs based on the taxonomic analysis was assigned to the domain Eukarya, which accounted for 99% of the total number of the putative CDSs. Of 9,449 eukaryotic CDSs whose functions could be categorized, approximately 40% of the putative CDSs corresponded to metabolism-related genes, including genes involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Among the carbohydrate-metabolism genes, 129 sequences encoded glycoside hydrolase enzymes, with 47 sequences being putative cellulases belonging to 13 GH families. To characterize the function of glycoside hydrolase enzymes, we synthesized the putative CelA gene with codon optimization for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, which was shown to be similar to the structure of plant expansins, and observed stimulation for cellulase activity on Avicel degradation. This study demonstrated that fungal communities adapt to Avicel and wheat decomposition and that metatranscriptomic sequence data can be reference data for identifying a novel gene.
