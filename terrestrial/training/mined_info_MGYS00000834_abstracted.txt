publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Herein, we applied a community genomic approach using a naphthalene-enriched community (CN1) to isolate a versatile esterase (CN1E1) from the Alfa/Beta-hydrolase family. The protein shares low-to-medium identity (<= 57%) with known esterase/lipase-like proteins. The enzyme is most active at 25-30C and pH 8.5; it retains approximately 55% of its activity at 4C and less than 8% at >= 55C, which indicates that it is a cold-adapted enzyme. CN1E1 has a distinct substrate preference compared with other Alfa/Beta-hydrolases because it is catalytically most active for hydrolysing polyaromatic hydrocarbon (phenanthrene, anthracene, naphthalene, benzoyl, protocatechuate and phthalate) esters (7200-21 000 units g(-1) protein at 40C and pH 8.0). The enzyme also accepts 44 structurally different common esters with different levels of enantio-selectivity (1.0-55 000 units g(-1) protein), including (+/-)-menthyl-acetate, (+/-)-neomenthyl acetate, (+/-)-pantolactone, (+/-)-methyl-mandelate, (+/-)-methyl-lactate and (+/-)-glycidyl 4-nitrobenzoate (in that order). The results provide the first biochemical evidence suggesting that such broad-spectrum esterases may be an ecological advantage for bacteria that mineralize recalcitrant pollutants (including oil refinery products, plasticizers and pesticides) as carbon sources under pollution pressure. They also offer a new tool for the stereo-assembly (i.e. through ester bonds) of multi-aromatic molecules with benzene rings that are useful for biology, chemistry and materials sciences for cases in which enzyme methods are not yet available.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Microbial metabolism in aromatic-contaminated environments has important ecological implications, and obtaining a complete understanding of this process remains a relevant goal. To understand the roles of biodiversity and aromatic-mediated genetic and metabolic rearrangements, we conducted 'OMIC' investigations in an anthropogenically influenced and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated soil with (Nbs) or without (N) bio-stimulation with calcium ammonia nitrate, NH(4)NO(3) and KH(2)PO(4) and the commercial surfactant Iveysol, plus two naphthalene-enriched communities derived from both soils (CN2 and CN1, respectively). Using a metagenomic approach, a total of 52, 53, 14 and 12 distinct species (according to operational phylogenetic units (OPU) in our work equivalent to taxonomic species) were identified in the N, Nbs, CN1 and CN2 communities, respectively. Approximately 10 out of 95 distinct species and 238 out of 3293 clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) protein families identified were clearly stimulated under the assayed conditions, whereas only two species and 1465 COGs conformed to the common set in all of the mesocosms. Results indicated distinct biodegradation capabilities for the utilisation of potential growth-supporting aromatics, which results in bio-stimulated communities being extremely fit to naphthalene utilisation and non-stimulated communities exhibiting a greater metabolic window than previously predicted. On the basis of comparing protein expression profiles and metagenome data sets, inter-alia interactions among members were hypothesised. The utilisation of curated databases is discussed and used for first time to reconstruct 'presumptive' degradation networks for complex microbial communities.
