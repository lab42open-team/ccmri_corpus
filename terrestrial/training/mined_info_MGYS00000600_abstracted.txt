study_name	Effect of DNA extraction methods on the determination of the structure of microbial communities in the phosphogypsum waste heap soil
study_abstract	The aim of this project is to compare the structure of bacterial communities, created by using different DNA extraction protocols, from soil samples of the phosphogypsum waste heap in Wislinka, (Poland, Pomeranian district). The selection of proper methods is of a high importance in every research, due to its influence on the obtained results and theirs interpretation. Therefore, in this project we want to verify, whether the DNA extraction methods have a significant impact on the proper recognition of the final structure of bacterial communities. During this study, we want to determine whether the results are strongly influenced by choice of DNA extraction protocols or significant changes in experimentally estimated structure of community cannot be observed. Several evaluation studies have been performed in order to compare DNA extraction methods from soil samples. However, these studies have never compared the diversity of obtained sequences by high-throughput sequencing. In this project we want to compare not only yield and purity of extracted DNA using different isolation protocols, but also the results of the sequencing, and their impact on recognized complexity of microbial community structure estimated on their basis. In this study we collected soil samples from the phosphogypsum waste heap in Wislinka, (Pomerania district). The heap was created from production wastes, mainly phosphogypsum and due to that fact it may be attractive place to study biodiversity of microorganisms. This study can be a valuable source of rare and unique types of bacteria living in very unique environmental conditions.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Metagenomics approaches and recent improvements in the next-generation sequencing methods, have become a method of choice in establishing a microbial population structure. Many commercial soil DNA extraction kits are available and due to their efficiency they are replacing traditional extraction protocols. However, differences in the physicochemical properties of soil samples require optimization of DNA extraction techniques for each sample separately. The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency, quality, and diversity of genetic material extracted with the use of commonly used kits. The comparative analysis of microbial community composition, displayed differences in microbial community structure depending on which kit was used. Statistical analysis indicated significant differences in recovery of the genetic material for 24 out of 32 analyzed phyla, and the most pronounced differences were seen for Actinobacteria. Also, diversity indexes and reproducibility of DNA extraction with the use of a given kit, varied among the tested methods. As the extraction protocol may influence the apparent structure of a microbial population, at the beginning of each project many extraction kits should be tested in order to choose one that would yield the most representative results and present the closest view to the actual structure of microbial population.
