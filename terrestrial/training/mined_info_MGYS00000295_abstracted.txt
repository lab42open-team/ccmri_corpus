study_name	Functional diversity of soil microbes across environmental gradients
study_abstract	Numerous globally distributed 16S rRNA surveys of soil bacterial communities are now revealing consistent trends in the main environmental drivers of biodiversity. Soil pH is consistently revealed as the predominant correlate of taxonomic diversity, with low pH soils comprising less diversity and being dominated by a few broad taxonomic groups such as the oligotrophic acidobacteria phylum. What is less clear is what these broad differences in patterns of taxonomic diversity mean for the functional genetic potential of soils. The low culturability of many taxa from low pH soils means that they are significantly underrepresented in genome sequence databases. Therefore, this study aims to provide a metagenomic comparison of geographically isolated soils of low pH with neutral pH soils to identify any broad functional differences between soils of similar taxonomic composition.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Environmental factors relating to soil pH are important regulators of bacterial taxonomic biodiversity, yet it remains unclear if such drivers affect community functional potential. To address this, we applied whole-genome metagenomics to eight geographically distributed soils at opposing ends of a landscape soil pH gradient (where "low-pH" is ~pH 4.3 and "high-pH" is ~pH 8.3) and evaluated functional differences with respect to functionally annotated genes. First, differences in taxonomic and functional diversity between the two pH categories were assessed with respect to alpha diversity (mean sample richness) and gamma diversity (total richness pooled for each pH category). Low-pH soils, also exhibiting higher organic matter and moisture, consistently had lower taxonomic alpha and gamma diversity, but this was not apparent in assessments of functional alpha and gamma diversity. However, coherent changes in the relative abundances of annotated genes between low- and high-pH soils were identified; with strong multivariate clustering of samples according to pH independent of geography. Assessment of indicator genes revealed that the acidic organic-rich soils possessed a greater abundance of cation efflux pumps, C and N direct fixation systems, and fermentation pathways, indicating adaptations to both acidity and anaerobiosis. Conversely, high-pH soils possessed more direct transporter-mediated mechanisms for organic C and N substrate acquisition. These findings highlight the distinctive physiological adaptations required for bacteria to survive in soils of various nutrient availability and edaphic conditions and more generally indicate that bacterial functional versatility with respect to functional gene annotations may not be constrained by taxonomy.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Over a set of soil samples spanning Britain, the widely reported reductions in bacterial taxonomic richness at low pH were found not to be accompanied by significant reductions in the richness of functional genes. However, consistent changes in the abundance of related functional genes were observed, characteristic of differential ecological and nutrient acquisition strategies between high-pH mineral soils and low-pH organic anaerobic soils. Our assessment at opposing ends of a soil gradient encapsulates the limits of functional diversity in temperate climates and identifies key pathways that may serve as indicators for soil element cycling and C storage processes in other soil systems. To this end, we make available a data set identifying functional indicators of the different soils; as well as raw sequences, which given the geographic scale of our sampling should be of value in future studies assessing novel genetic diversity of a wide range of soil functional attributes.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	In soil, bioavailable inorganic orthophosphate is found at low concentrations and thus limits biological growth. To overcome this phosphorus scarcity, plants and bacteria secrete numerous enzymes, namely acid and alkaline phosphatases, which cleave orthophosphate from various organic phosphorus substrates. Using profile hidden Markov modeling approaches, we investigated the abundance of various non specific phosphatases, both acid and alkaline, in metagenomes retrieved from soils with contrasting pH regimes. This analysis uncovered a marked reduction in the abundance and diversity of various alkaline phosphatases in low-pH soils that was not counterbalanced by an increase in acid phosphatases. Furthermore, it was also discovered that only half of the bacterial strains from different phyla deposited in the Integrated Microbial Genomes database harbor alkaline phosphatases. Taken together, our data suggests that these 'phosphatase lacking' isolates likely increase in low-pH soils and future research should ascertain how these bacteria overcome phosphorus scarcity.

publication_nr_2_pubmed_abstract	Several technical challenges in metagenomic data analysis, including assembling metagenomic sequence data or identifying operational taxonomic units, are both significant and well known. These forms of analysis are increasingly cited as conceptually flawed, given the extreme variation within traditionally defined species and rampant horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, computational requirements of such analysis have hindered content-based organization of metagenomic data at large scale. In this article, we introduce the Amordad database engine for alignment-free, content-based indexing of metagenomic datasets. Amordad places the metagenome comparison problem in a geometric context, and uses an indexing strategy that combines random hashing with a regular nearest neighbor graph. This framework allows refinement of the database over time by continual application of random hash functions, with the effect of each hash function encoded in the nearest neighbor graph. This eliminates the need to explicitly maintain the hash functions in order for query efficiency to benefit from the accumulated randomness. Results on real and simulated data show that Amordad can support logarithmic query time for identifying similar metagenomes even as the database size reaches into the millions.
