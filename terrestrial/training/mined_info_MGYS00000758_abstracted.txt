publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	For the past 60 years Caulobacter spp. have been commonly attributed an aquatic and oligotrophic lifestyle yet are not uncommon in nutrient-rich or soil environments. This study evaluates the environmental and ecological associations of Caulobacter to reconcile past evidence, largely limited to culturing and microscopy, with currently available metagenomic and genomic data. The distribution of Caulobacter species and their characteristic adhesion-conferring genes, holdfast (hfaAB), were determined using collections of 10,641 16S rRNA gene libraries (196 studies) and 2625 shotgun metagenomes (190 studies) from a range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Evidence for ecotypic variation was tested in 26 genomes sourced from soil, rhizosphere, plant, groundwater, and water. Caulobacter were, on average, fourfold more relatively abundant in soil than in aquatic environments, and abundant in decomposing wood, compost, and particulate matter (in air and water). Caulobacter holdfast genes were 35-fold more abundant in soils than aquatic environments. Ecotypic differences between soil and aquatic Caulobacter were evident in the environmental associations of several species and differences in genome size and content among isolates. However, most abundant species were common to both environments, suggesting populations exist in a continuum that was evident in the re-analysis of studies on the temporal dynamics of, and sources of bacterioplankton to, lakes and rivers. This study provides a new perspective on the ecological profile of Caulobacter, demonstrating that members of this genus are predominantly soil-borne, possess an overlooked role in plant matter decomposition and a dependency on water-mediated dispersal.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Wood recycling is key to forest biogeochemical cycles, largely driven by microorganisms such as white-rot fungi which naturally coexist with bacteria in the environment. We have tested whether and to what extent the diversity of the bacterial community associated with wood decay is determined by wood and/or by white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. We combined a microcosm approach with an enrichment procedure, using beech sawdust inoculated with or without P.chrysosporium. During 18 weeks, we used 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing to monitor the forest bacterial community inoculated into these microcosms. We found bacterial communities associated with wood to be substantially less diverse than the initial forest soil inoculum. The presence of most bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) varied over time and between replicates, regardless of their treatment, suggestive of the stochastic processes. However, we observed two OTUs belonging to Xanthomonadaceae and Rhizobium, together representing 50% of the relative bacterial abundance, as consistently associated with the wood substrate, regardless of fungal presence. Moreover, after 12 weeks, the bacterial community composition based on relative abundance was significantly modified by the presence of the white-rot fungus. Effectively, members of the Burkholderia genus were always associated with P.chrysosporium, representing potential taxonomic bioindicators of the white-rot mycosphere.
