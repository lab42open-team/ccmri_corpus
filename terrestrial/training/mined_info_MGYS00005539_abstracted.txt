study_name	Non-target effects of Metarhizium brunneum on soil microbial communities
study_abstract	The aim of this project was the assessment of potential non-target effects of the entomopathogenic fungus and biological control agent Metarhizium brunneum on soil fungal and prokaryotic community structures. To our knowledge, this research question was assessed for the first time using next generation sequencing technology of ribosomal markers. Non-target effect studies are required for product registration and expand knowledge on the impact of agricultural applications to the environment. M. brunneum was applied against Agriotes spp. in potato in a pot. The presence of the applied strain and the microbial community structures were monitored in soil over 4 months (1 pre-treatment sampling and 2 post-treatment samplings). M. brunneum was applied in different formulations and as unformulated spores. Controls included an insecticide, non-fungal components of the formulations and untreated pots.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The release of large quantities of microorganisms to soil for purposes such as pest control or plant growth promotion may affect the indigenous soil microbial communities. In our study, we investigated potential effects of Metarhizium brunneum ART2825 on soil fungi and prokaryota in bulk soil using high-throughput sequencing of ribosomal markers. Different formulations of this strain, and combinations of the fungus with garlic as efficacy-enhancing agent, were tested over 4 months in a pot and a field experiment carried out for biological control of Agriotes spp. in potatoes. A biocontrol effect was observed only in the pot experiment, i.e. the application of FCBK resulted in 77% efficacy. Colony counts combined with genotyping and marker sequence abundance confirmed the successful establishment of the applied strain. Only the formulated applied strain caused small shifts in fungal communities in the pot experiment. Treatment effects were in the same range as the effects caused by barley kernels, the carrier of the FCBK formulation and temporal effects. Garlic treatments and time affected prokaryotic communities. In the field experiment, only spatial differences affected fungal and prokaryotic communities. Our findings suggest that M. brunneum may not adversely affect soil microbial communities.
