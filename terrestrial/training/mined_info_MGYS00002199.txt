study_name	Comparison of copper contaminated soils, with similar uncontaminated controls.
study_abstract	Two sites of long-term copper polluted soil were sampled, along with nearby uncontaminated controls. All treatments were carried out and sampled in triplicate. A third site was samples at a copper mine, though the control site was of a dissimilar soil type and only single samples of each were taken.Marker taxa and gene functional groups will be identified between polluted and control soils.
