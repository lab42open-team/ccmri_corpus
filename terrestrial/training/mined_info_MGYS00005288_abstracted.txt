study_name	Networks depicting the fine-scale co-occurrences of fungi in soil horizons
study_abstract	Fungi in soil play pivotal roles in nutrient cycling, pest controls, and plant community succession in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the ecosystem functions provided by soil fungi, our knowledge of the assembly processes of belowground fungi has been limited. Based on the high-throughput sequencing data of fungi in a cool temperate forest in northern Japan, we analyze how taxonomically and functionally diverse fungi show correlated fine-scale distributions in soil. By uncovering pairs of fungi that co-occurred in the same soil samples more/less frequently than expected by chance, networks depicting fine-scale distributions of fungi are inferred at the O and A horizons. The results then leads to the working hypothesis that mycorrhizal, endophytic, saprotrophic, and pathogenic fungi as well as fungi with unknown functions form compartmentalized networks of potential facilitative, antagonistic, and/or competitive interactions in belowground ecosystems. Overall, this study provides a research basis for further understanding how interspecific interactions, along with sharing of niches among fungi, drive the dynamics of poorly explored biospheres in soil.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Fungi in soil play pivotal roles in nutrient cycling, pest controls, and plant community succession in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the ecosystem functions provided by soil fungi, our knowledge of the assembly processes of belowground fungi has been limited. In particular, we still have limited knowledge of how diverse functional groups of fungi interact with each other in facilitative and competitive ways in soil. Based on the high-throughput sequencing data of fungi in a cool-temperate forest in northern Japan, we analyzed how taxonomically and functionally diverse fungi showed correlated fine-scale distributions in soil. By uncovering pairs of fungi that frequently co-occurred in the same soil samples, networks depicting fine-scale co-occurrences of fungi were inferred at the O (organic matter) and A (surface soil) horizons. The results then led to the working hypothesis that mycorrhizal, endophytic, saprotrophic, and pathogenic fungi could form compartmentalized (modular) networks of facilitative, antagonistic, and/or competitive interactions in belowground ecosystems. Overall, this study provides a research basis for further understanding how interspecific interactions, along with sharing of niches among fungi, drive the dynamics of poorly explored biospheres in soil.
