study_abstract	A central goal in ecology is to understand the factors that control microbial biodiversity and patterns in spatial distribution. In this project, the effect of limited tillage versus traditional tillage, residue retention versus removal and crop rotation (maize-wheat) versus monoculture (maize) on the bacterial community structure is being investigated.
