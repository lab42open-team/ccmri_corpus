study_name	Diversity of bacteria, archaea, fungi and algae in coal mine drainage remediation systems treating elevated manganese
study_abstract	Water discharging from abandoned coal mines can contain extremely high manganese levels, and removing this metal is an ongoing challenge. Passive Mn remediation systems promote the growth of certain bacteria and fungi that catalyze the transformation of soluble Mn(II) to insoluble Mn(III/IV) minerals, but system performance is unpredictable. Mn-oxidizing organisms likely belong to complex communities that include algae and archaea, as well as bacteria and fungi that do not oxidize Mn. Community interactions could be modulating the efficiency of Mn oxidation in the treatment beds. Using a targeted sequencing approach, we aimed to determine the diversity and composition of microbial communities inhabiting several different Mn remediation systems, compared with surrounding uncontaminated soil, and to establish the abundance of known Mn-oxidizing microorganisms relative to the entire community. Four Mn treatment beds in Pennsylvania were selected, each treating metal-contaminated discharge from abandoned coal mines. Rock or sediment samples were collected near the influent, in the middle and near the effluent of each bed, as well as from surrounding uncontaminated soil. Amplicon pyrosequencing was carried out with primers targeting bacteria (small subunit rRNA), archaea (small subunit rRNA), fungi (internal transcribed spacer) and algae (plastid large subunit rRNA).

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Water discharging from abandoned coal mines can contain extremely high manganese levels. Removing this metal is an ongoing challenge. Passive Mn(II) removal beds (MRBs) contain microorganisms that oxidize soluble Mn(II) to insoluble Mn(III/IV) minerals, but system performance is unpredictable. Using amplicon pyrosequencing, we profiled the bacterial, fungal, algal, and archaeal communities in four MRBs, performing at different levels, in Pennsylvania to determine whether they differed among MRBs and from surrounding soil and to establish the relative abundance of known Mn(II) oxidizers. Archaea were not detected; PCRs with archaeal primers returned only nontarget bacterial sequences. Fungal taxonomic profiles differed starkly between sites that remove the majority of influent Mn and those that do not, with the former being dominated by Ascomycota (mostly Dothideomycetes) and the latter by Basidiomycota (almost entirely Agaricomycetes). Taxonomic profiles for the other groups did not differ significantly between MRBs, but operational taxonomic unit-based analyses showed significant clustering by MRB with all three groups (P &lt; 0.05). Soil samples clustered separately from MRBs in all groups except fungi, whose soil samples clustered loosely with their respective MRB. Known Mn(II) oxidizers accounted for a minor proportion of bacterial sequences (up to 0.20%) but a greater proportion of fungal sequences (up to 14.78%). MRB communities are more diverse than previously thought, and more organisms may be capable of Mn(II) oxidation than are currently known.
