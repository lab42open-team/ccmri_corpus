study_name	Bacterial community diversity and structure of winter wheat-cultivated soils
study_abstract	Bacterial community diversity and structure of two typical grain food rotations of winter wheat-rice and winter wheat-maize soon after wheat harvested are studied. It will help us have a knowledge of sustainable agriculture systems. In this study, soil samples were collected soon after winter wheat harvest from two typical rotation systems, i. e. winter wheat-rice located in Changshu (CS), Jintan (JT), and Zhangjiagang (ZJG), Jiangsu province and winter wheat-maize located in Dezhou (DZ), Shandong province, and in Quzhou (QZ), Hebei province in China.
