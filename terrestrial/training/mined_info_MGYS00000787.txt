study_abstract	Phosphorus fertilization is an important agricultural practice for improving plant nutrition and achieving high crop yield, due to their effects on soil cycling of organic compounds, soil nutrient dynamics. As the underling mechanisms, soil microorganisms play critical roles in regulating the cycling of carbon, nutrient availability and soil fertility since these organisms regulate many fundamental processes. Thus microbial indicators such as microbial diversity and composition are believed to be more dynamic than based on physical and chemical properties, and may have the potential to serve as early indicators of change in the quality of the soil ecosystem. This study determined the effects of phosphorus fertilization on soil bacterial community structures and corresponding changes in soil quality. A plot experiment on P management for paddy field was established in April 2005 at the demonstration park of YuHang County Agricultural Research Station (3018''51.84"N, 11954''13.37"E) in ZheJiang, China. The soil samples from a field experiment after 7-year of chemical P fertilization with superphosphate along a gradient of 0 (P-0), 30 (P-30), 60 (P-60), 90 (P-90) kg P ha-1.y-1 , using superphosphate since 2005, in order to evaluate the role of P on the bacterial community structure.
