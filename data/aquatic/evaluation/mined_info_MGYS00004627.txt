study_abstract	Cores were collected over a year long period from sites associated with three transects in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Surface sediments were analyzed to determine patterns in Bacteria and Archaea within these samples and comparisons made to patterns observed for microeukaryotes. The study aimed to determine how location, season and sediment characteristics influence diversity and community structure. Similarities or differences in patterns among the three domains were identified.
