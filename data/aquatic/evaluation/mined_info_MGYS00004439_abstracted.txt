study_name	Bacterial community profiles in a bioreduced uranium contaminated site after reoxidation
study_abstract	A site contaminated with uranium was bioreduced through multiple injections of ethanol to immobilize the uranium in situ. Then it was allowed to reoxidize via the invasion of low-pH , high-nitrate groundwater back into the reduced zone for about 4 years. To examine the biogeochemical response, high-throughput sequencing were applied to characterize bacterial population shifts.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Water quality is an important determinant for the structural integrity of alloy cladded fuels and assemblies during long-term wet storage. Detailed characterization of a water filled storage basin for spent nuclear reactor fuel was performed following the formation and proliferation of an amorphous white flocculent. White precipitant was sampled throughout the storage basin for chemical and spectroscopic characterization, and environmental DNA was extracted for 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity. Accordingly, spectroscopic analyses indicated the precipitant to be primarily amorphous to crystalline aluminum (oxy) hydroxides with minor associated elemental components including Fe, Si, Ti, and U. High levels of organic carbon were co-localized with the precipitant relative to bulk dissolved organic concentrations. Bacterial densities were highly variable between sampling locations and with depth within the water filled storage basin; cell numbers ranged from 4 x 10<sup>3</sup>to 4 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/mL. Bacterial diversity that was physically associated with the aluminum (oxy) hydroxide complexes exceeded an estimated 4,000 OTUs/amplicon library (3% cutoff) and the majority of sequences were aligned to the families <i>Burkholderiaceae</i> (23%), <i>Nitrospiraceae</i> (23%), <i>Hyphomicrobiaceae</i> (17%), and <i>Comamonadaceae</i> (6%). We surmise that episodic changes in the physical and chemical properties of the basin contribute to the polymerization of aluminum (oxy) hydroxides, which in turn can chemisorb nutrients, carbon ligands and bacterial cells from the surrounding bulk aqueous phase. As such, these precipitants should establish favorable microhabitats for bacterial colonization and growth. Comparative analyses of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries across a selection of natural and engineered aquatic ecosystems were performed and microbial community and taxonomic signatures unique to the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) storage basin environment were revealed. These insights could spur the development of tractable bio-indicators that are specific of and diagnostic for water quality at discrete locations and finer scales of resolution, marking an important contribution for improved water quality and management of SNF storage facilities.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	A site in Oak Ridge, TN, USA, has sediments that contain &gt;3% iron oxides and is contaminated with uranium (U). The U(VI) was bioreduced to U(IV) and immobilized <i>in situ</i> through intermittent injections of ethanol. It then was allowed to reoxidize via the invasion of low-pH (3.6 to 4.0), high-nitrate (up to 200 mM) groundwater back into the reduced zone for 1,383 days. To examine the biogeochemical response, high-throughput sequencing and network analysis were applied to characterize bacterial population shifts, as well as cooccurrence and coexclusion patterns among microbial communities. A paired <i>t</i> test indicated no significant changes of Alfa-diversity for the bioactive wells. However, both nonmetric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity confirmed a significant distinction in the overall composition of the bacterial communities between the bioreduced and the reoxidized sediments. The top 20 major genera accounted for &gt;70% of the cumulative contribution to the dissimilarity in the bacterial communities before and after the groundwater invasion. <i>Castellaniella</i> had the largest dissimilarity contribution (17.7%). For the bioactive wells, the abundance of the U(VI)-reducing genera <i>Geothrix</i>, <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, <i>Ferribacterium</i>, and <i>Geobacter</i> decreased significantly, whereas the denitrifying <i>Acidovorax</i> abundance increased significantly after groundwater invasion. Additionally, seven genera, i.e., <i>Castellaniella</i>, <i>Ignavibacterium</i>, <i>Simplicispira</i>, <i>Rhizomicrobium</i>, <i>Acidobacteria</i> Gp1, <i>Acidobacteria</i> Gp14, and <i>Acidobacteria</i> Gp23, were significant indicators of bioactive wells in the reoxidation stage. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that nitrate, manganese, and pH affected mostly the U(VI)-reducing genera and indicator genera. Cooccurrence patterns among microbial taxa suggested the presence of taxa sharing similar ecological niches or mutualism/commensalism/synergism interactions.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> High-throughput sequencing technology in combination with a network analysis approach were used to investigate the stabilization of uranium and the corresponding dynamics of bacterial communities under field conditions with regard to the heterogeneity and complexity of the subsurface over the long term. The study also examined diversity and microbial community composition shift, the common genera, and indicator genera before and after long-term contaminated-groundwater invasion and the relationship between the target functional community structure and environmental factors. Additionally, deciphering cooccurrence and coexclusion patterns among microbial taxa and environmental parameters could help predict potential biotic interactions (cooperation/competition), shared physiologies, or habitat affinities, thus, improving our understanding of ecological niches occupied by certain specific species. These findings offer new insights into compositions of and associations among bacterial communities and serve as a foundation for future bioreduction implementation and monitoring efforts applied to uranium-contaminated sites.
