study_name	Santa Barbara Channel cruise SBDOM11 bacterioplankton 16S rDNA
study_abstract	This sample includes environmental bacterioplankton DNA from the SBDOM11 cruise in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA, in May 2011, as well as associated experimental samples from remineralization bioassays. This project traced the bacterial response to the DOM produced by an upwelling-driven phytoplankton bloom, from recently upwelled water through the onset of nutrient stress.
