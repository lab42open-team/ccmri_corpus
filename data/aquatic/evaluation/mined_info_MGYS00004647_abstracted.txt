publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	This work included the primer design details of Quantitative Microbial Elemental Cycling (QMEC) method, a high-throughput qPCR method for microbial carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S) and methane metabolism potential detection and assessment. We designed 36 novel primers based on their amino acid sequences. Via illumina sequencing technology, their phylogenetic taxonomy was identified and analyzed to validate the primer specificity.
