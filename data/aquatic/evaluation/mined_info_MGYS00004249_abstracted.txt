study_abstract	In response to contemporary threats to biodiversity, accurate and objective methods of species or operational taxonomic unit (OTU) assessment are fundamental to our understanding of mechanistic links among ecosystem components and resilience. Second generation sequencing approaches have been especially insightful for biodiversity analyses of the microbial biosphere, but to date, such approaches have not been used to study Metazoan phyla. Here, we utilize second generation sequencing for interpreting the relative richness of multiple metazoan phyla inhabiting the marine benthos. We identify (a.) comparative and substantial levels of unrecorded richness, that refute currently accepted paradigms of phylum rank abundance, (b.) ecosystem-level community composition at fine level spatial hierarchical scales and (c.) sequences derived from putative metazoan taxa that bear little genetic resemblance to any phylum that has been sequenced previously. These findings suggest that such techniques will provide a valuable addition to the exploratory tool-box for rapidly and simultaneously documenting the identity, composition and potential function of hitherto intractable, but ecologically important, communities.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Biodiversity is of crucial importance for ecosystem functioning, sustainability and resilience, but the magnitude and organization of marine diversity at a range of spatial and taxonomic scales are undefined. In this paper, we use second-generation sequencing to unmask putatively diverse marine metazoan biodiversity in a Scottish temperate benthic ecosystem. We show that remarkable differences in diversity occurred at microgeographical scales and refute currently accepted ecological and taxonomic paradigms of meiofaunal identity, rank abundance and concomitant understanding of trophic dynamics. Richness estimates from the current benchmarked Operational Clustering of Taxonomic Units from Parallel UltraSequencing analyses are broadly aligned with those derived from morphological assessments. However, the slope of taxon rarefaction curves for many phyla remains incomplete, suggesting that the true alpha diversity is likely to exceed current perceptions. The approaches provide a rapid, objective and cost-effective taxonomic framework for exploring links between ecosystem structure and function of all hitherto intractable, but ecologically important, communities.
