study_name	Specialists instead of generalists oxidize alkanes in anoxic marine hydrocarbon seep sediments
study_abstract	The anaerobic oxidation of non-methane hydrocarbons mediated by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) is a major process of organic matter degradation at marine hydrocarbon seeps. Several SRB have been successfully cultured, however, knowledge about in situ active organisms is still very limited. Here, we identified alkane-degrading key players from two contrasting seeps at the Mediterranean Amon Mud Volcano (Amon MV) and Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California using complementary stable-isotope probing (SIP) techniques. Anoxic sediments were incubated with 13C-labeled butane or dodecane under close to in situ conditions. DNA- and RNA-based SIP in combination with 454-pyrosequencing (PYRO-SIP) allowed the identification of four phylogenetically distinct deltaproteobacterial groups of alkane-oxidizing SRB within the family Desulfobacteraceae. We named the groups degrading short-chain alkanes ‘SCA-SRB1' and ‘SCA-SRB2' and those degrading long-chain alkanes ‘LCA-SRB1' and ‘LCA-SRB2'. CARD-FISH with newly developed specific probes revealed a high relative in situ abundance of SCA-SRB1 and SCA-SRB2 with 2% of the total community, while groups LCA-SRB1 and LCA-SRB2 were below 1% of total cells. Protein-based SIP (Protein-SIP), which enables to trace stable isotopes from substrate to protein, confirmed alkane-degrading key players of the family Desulfobacteraceae. In addition, Protein-SIP indicated additional carbon sources for 13C biosynthesis besides alkanes, and gave insights into possible metabolic pathways: (1-methylalkyl)succinylation as initial step of butane degradation and the oxidative Wood–Ljungdahl pathway as terminal point of alkane degradation.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Biogeochemical and microbiological data indicate that the anaerobic oxidation of non-methane hydrocarbons by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) has an important role in carbon and sulfur cycling at marine seeps. Yet, little is known about the bacterial hydrocarbon degraders active in situ. Here, we provide the link between previous biogeochemical measurements and the cultivation of degraders by direct identification of SRB responsible for butane and dodecane degradation in complex on-site microbiota. Two contrasting seep sediments from Mediterranean Amon mud volcano and Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California) were incubated with (13)C-labeled butane or dodecane under sulfate-reducing conditions and analyzed via complementary stable isotope probing (SIP) techniques. Using DNA- and rRNA-SIP, we identified four specialized clades of alkane oxidizers within Desulfobacteraceae to be distinctively active in oxidation of short- and long-chain alkanes. All clades belong to the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus (DSS) clade, substantiating the crucial role of these bacteria in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation at marine seeps. The identification of key enzymes of anaerobic alkane degradation, subsequent Beta-oxidation and the reverse Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for complete substrate oxidation by protein-SIP further corroborated the importance of the DSS clade and indicated that biochemical pathways, analog to those discovered in the laboratory, are of great relevance for natural settings. The high diversity within identified subclades together with their capability to initiate alkane degradation and growth within days to weeks after substrate amendment suggest an overlooked potential of marine benthic microbiota to react to natural changes in seepage, as well as to massive hydrocarbon input, for example, as encountered during anthropogenic oil spills.
