study_name	Salt marshes sediment microhabitats Metagenome
study_abstract	In the present study, microbial communities of bulk and rhizosphere sediments were investigated using barcoded pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Our main goals were to compare the bacterial richness and composition of bulk sediment and two plant species inhabiting salt marsh systems. FLX 454 titanium pyrosequencing study. Note that the sequences submitted are raw sequences after demultiplexing thus without a chimera check and other quality filtering. These will need to be filtered out using, e.g., using qiime scripts such as split_libraries and pick_otus with the usearch_ref argument, which will provide a chimera check and filter out poor quality sequences.
