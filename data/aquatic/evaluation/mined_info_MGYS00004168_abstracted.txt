study_name	Simulated crude oil seepage Caspian Sea Raw sequence reads
study_abstract	The response of the microbial community to a crude oil seepage simulated for 190 days under close-to-in situ conditions in a sediment core from Caspian Sea using a Sediment-Oil-Flow-Through (SOFT) system was studied by NGS sequencing. We hypothesize that specific taxa respond specifically to simulated crude oil seepage by an increase of their cell numbers resulting in a change of community composition.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Anaerobic microbial hydrocarbon degradation is a major biogeochemical process at marine seeps. Here we studied the response of the microbial community to petroleum seepage simulated for 190 days in a sediment core from the Caspian Sea using a sediment-oil-flow-through (SOFT) system. Untreated (without simulated petroleum seepage) and SOFT sediment microbial communities shared 43% bacterial genus-level 16S rRNA-based operational taxonomic units (OTU<sub>0.945</sub>) but shared only 23% archaeal OTU<sub>0.945</sub>. The community differed significantly between sediment layers. The detection of fourfold higher deltaproteobacterial cell numbers in SOFT than in untreated sediment at depths characterized by highest sulfate reduction rates and strongest decrease of gaseous and mid-chain alkane concentrations indicated a specific response of hydrocarbon-degrading Deltaproteobacteria. Based on an increase in specific CARD-FISH cell numbers, we suggest the following groups of sulfate-reducing bacteria to be likely responsible for the observed decrease in aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon concentration in SOFT sediments: clade SCA1 for propane and butane degradation, clade LCA2 for mid- to long-chain alkane degradation, clade Cyhx for cycloalkanes, pentane and hexane degradation, and relatives of <i>Desulfobacula</i> for toluene degradation. Highest numbers of archaea of the genus <i>Methanosarcina</i> were found in the methanogenic zone of the SOFT core where we detected preferential degradation of long-chain hydrocarbons. Sequencing of <i>masD</i>, a marker gene for alkane degradation encoding (1-methylalkyl)succinate synthase, revealed a low diversity in SOFT sediment with two abundant species-level MasD OTU<sub>0.96</sub>.
