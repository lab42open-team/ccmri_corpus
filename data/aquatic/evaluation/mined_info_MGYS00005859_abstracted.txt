publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Glaciers and their microbiomes are exceptional witnesses of the environmental conditions from remote times. Climate change is threatening mountain glaciers, and especially those found in southern Europe, such as the Monte Perdido Glacier (northern Spain, Central Pyrenees). This study focuses on the reconstruction of the history of microbial communities over time. The microorganisms that inhabit the Monte Perdido Glacier were identified using high-throughput sequencing, and the microbial communities were compared along an altitudinal transect covering most of the preserved ice sequence in the glacier. The results showed that the glacial ice age gradient did shape the diversity of microbial populations, which presented large differences throughout the last 2000 years. Variations in microbial community diversity were influenced by glacial conditions over time (nutrient concentration, chemical composition, and ice age). Some groups were exclusively identified in the oldest samples as the bacterial phyla Fusobacteria and Calditrichaeota, or the eukaryotic class Rhodophyceae. Among groups only found in modern samples, the green sulfur bacteria (phylum Chlorobi) stood out, as well as the bacterial phylum Gemmatimonadetes and the eukaryotic class Tubulinea. A patent impact of human contamination was also observed on the glacier microbiome. The oldest samples, corresponding to the Roman Empire times, were influenced by the beginning of mining exploitation in the Pyrenean area, with the presence of metal-tolerant microorganisms. The most recent samples comprise 600-year-old ancient ice in which current communities are living.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Glaciers are populated by a large number of microorganisms including bacteria, archaea and microeukaryotes. Several factors such as solar radiation, nutrient availability and water content greatly determine the diversity and abundance of these microbial populations, the type of metabolism and the biogeochemical cycles. Three ecosystems can be differentiated in glaciers: supraglacial, subglacial and englacial ecosystems. Firstly, the supraglacial ecosystem, sunlit and oxygenated, is predominantly populated by photoautotrophic microorganisms. Secondly, the subglacial ecosystem contains a majority of chemoautotrophs that are fed on the mineral salts of the rocks and basal soil. Lastly, the englacial ecosystem is the least studied and the one that contains the smallest number of microorganisms. However, these unknown englacial microorganisms establish a food web and appear to have an active metabolism. In order to study their metabolic potentials, samples of englacial ice were taken from an Antarctic glacier. Microorganisms were analyzed by a polyphasic approach that combines a set of -omic techniques: 16S rRNA sequencing, culturomics and metaproteomics. This combination provides key information about diversity and functions of microbial populations, especially in rare habitats. Several whole essential proteins and enzymes related to metabolism and energy production, recombination and translation were found that demonstrate the existence of cellular activity at subzero temperatures. In this way it is shown that the englacial microorganisms are not quiescent, but that they maintain an active metabolism and play an important role in the glacial microbial community.
