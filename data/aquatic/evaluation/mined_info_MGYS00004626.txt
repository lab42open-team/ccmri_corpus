study_abstract	This work will provide a model for the large-scale extension of molecular phylogenetic-type analysis of direct study, characterization, and secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters that remain hidden in soil microbiomes of Sundarbans. Genome base study with the theoretical prediction of structures will provide importance for the discovery of natural products in the future from Sundarbans ecosystem. The expansion of the genomic sequence will exhibit potential route for synthetic biology approaches and metabolic research. Preliminary data on this screening will demonstrate great economic interest.
