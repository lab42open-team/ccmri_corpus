publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	"<i>Candidatus</i> Actinomarinales" was defined as a subclass of exclusively marine <i>Actinobacteria</i> with small cells and genomes. We have collected all the available genomes in databases to assess the diversity included in this group and analyzed it by comparative genomics. We have found the equivalent of five genera and 18 genomospecies. They have genome reduction parameters equal to those of freshwater actinobacterial "<i>Candidatus</i> Nanopelagicales" or marine alphaproteobacterial <i>Pelagibacterales</i> Genome recruitment shows that they are found only in the photic zone and mainly in surface waters, with only one genus that is found preferentially at or below the deep chlorophyll maximum. "<i>Ca</i> Actinomarinales" show a highly conserved core genome (80% of the gene families conserved for the whole order) with a saturation of genomic diversity of the flexible genome at the genomospecies level. We found only a flexible genomic island preserved throughout the order; it is related to the sugar decoration of the envelope and uses several tRNAs as hot spots to increase its genomic diversity. Populations had a discrete level of sequence diversity similar to other marine microbes but drastically different from the much higher levels found for <i>Pelagibacterales</i> Genomic analysis suggests that they are all aerobic photoheterotrophs with one type 1 rhodopsin and a heliorhodopsin. Like other actinobacteria, they possess the F420 coenzyme biosynthesis pathway, and its lower reduction potential could provide access to an increased range of redox chemical transformations. Last, sequence analysis revealed the first "<i>Ca</i> Actinomarinales" phages, including a prophage, with metaviromic islands related to sialic acid cleavage.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Microbiology is in a new age in which sequence databases are primary sources of information about many microbes. However, in-depth analysis of environmental genomes thus retrieved is essential to substantiate the new knowledge. Here, we study 182 genomes belonging to the only known exclusively marine pelagic group of the phylum <i>Actinobacteria</i> The aquatic branch of this phylum is largely known from environmental sequencing studies (single-amplified genomes [SAGs] and metagenome-assembled genomes [MAGs]), and we have collected and analyzed the available information present in databases about the "<i>Ca.</i> Actinomarinales." They are among the most streamlined microbes to live in the epipelagic zone of the ocean, and their study is critical to obtain a proper view of the diversity of <i>Actinobacteria</i> and their role in aquatic ecosystems.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	The SAR11 clade of <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> is the most abundant group of planktonic cells in the near-surface epipelagic waters of the ocean, but the mechanisms underlying its exceptional success have not been fully elucidated. Here, we applied a metagenomic approach to explore microdiversity patterns by measuring the accumulation of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations as well as homologous recombination in populations of SAR11 from different aquatic habitats (marine epipelagic, bathypelagic, and surface freshwater). The patterns of mutation accumulation and recombination were compared to those of other groups of representative marine microbes with multiple ecological strategies that share the same marine habitat, namely, <i>Cyanobacteria</i> (<i>Prochlorococcus</i> and <i>Synechococcus</i>), <i>Archaea</i> ("<i>Candidatus</i> Nitrosopelagicus" and Marine Group II <i>Thalassoarchaea</i>), and some heterotrophic marine bacteria (<i>Alteromonas</i> and <i>Erythrobacter</i>). SAR11 populations showed widespread recombination among distantly related members, preventing divergence leading to a genetically stable population. Moreover, their high intrapopulation sequence diversity with an enrichment in synonymous replacements supports the idea of a very ancient divergence and the coexistence of multiple different clones. However, other microbes analyzed seem to follow different evolutionary dynamics where processes of diversification driven by geographic and ecological instability produce a higher number of nonsynonymous replacements and lower intrapopulation sequence diversity. Together, these data shed light on some of the evolutionary and ecological processes that lead to the large genomic diversity in SAR11. Furthermore, this approach can be applied to other similar microbes that are difficult to culture in the laboratory, but abundant in nature, to investigate the underlying dynamics of their genomic evolution.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> As the most abundant bacteria in oceans, the <i>Pelagibacterales</i> order (here SAR11) plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, but the study of the evolutionary forces driving its evolution has lagged considerably due to the inherent difficulty of obtaining pure cultures. Multiple evolutionary models have been proposed to explain the diversification of distinct lineages within a population; however, the identification of many of these patterns in natural populations remains mostly enigmatic. We have used a metagenomic approach to explore microdiversity patterns in their natural habitats. Comparison with a collection of bacterial and archaeal groups from the same environments shows that SAR11 populations have a different evolutionary regime, where multiple genotypes coexist within the same population and remain stable over time. Widespread homologous recombination could be one of the main driving factors of this homogenization.

publication_nr_2_pubmed_abstract	Members of the SAR11 clade, despite their high abundance, are often poorly represented by metagenome-assembled genomes. This fact has hampered our knowledge about their ecology and genetic diversity. Here we examined 175 SAR11 genomes, including 47 new single-amplified genomes. The presence of the first genomes associated with subclade IV suggests that, in the same way as subclade V, they might be outside the proposed Pelagibacterales order. An expanded phylogenomic classification together with patterns of metagenomic recruitment at a global scale have allowed us to define new ecogenomic units of classification (genomospecies), appearing at different, and sometimes restricted, metagenomic data sets. We detected greater microdiversity across the water column at a single location than in samples collected from similar depth across the global ocean, suggesting little influence of biogeography. In addition, pangenome analysis revealed that the flexible genome was essential to shape genomospecies distribution. In one genomospecies preferentially found within the Mediterranean, a set of genes involved in phosphonate utilization was detected. While another, with a more cosmopolitan distribution, was unique in having an aerobic purine degradation pathway. Together, these results provide a glimpse of the enormous genomic diversity within this clade at a finer resolution than the currently defined clades.

publication_nr_3_pubmed_abstract	Recent advances in understanding the ecology of marine systems have been greatly facilitated by the growing availability of metagenomic data, which provide information on the identity, diversity and functional potential of the microbial community in a particular place and time. Here we present a dataset comprising over 5 terabases of metagenomic data from 610 samples spanning diverse regions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. One set of metagenomes, collected on GEOTRACES cruises, captures large geographic transects at multiple depths per station. The second set represents two years of time-series data, collected at roughly monthly intervals from 3 depths at two long-term ocean sampling sites, Station ALOHA and BATS. These metagenomes contain genomic information from a diverse range of bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and viruses. The data's utility is strengthened by the availability of extensive physical, chemical, and biological measurements associated with each sample. We expect that these metagenomes will facilitate a wide range of comparative studies that seek to illuminate new aspects of marine microbial ecosystems.
