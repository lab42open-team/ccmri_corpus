study_name	Diversity of Microbial Eukaryotes in Sea Waters From Fildes Peninsula,King George Island, Antarctica
study_abstract	To investigate molecular diversity of microbial eukaryotes in sea water from Greatwall cove and Ardley cove, Fildes Peninsula, ten water samples were collected during the 29th Chinese Antarctic scientific expedition in 2013. After pyrosequencing and analysis, the molecular diversity of microbial eukaryotes of sea water from Greatwall cove and Ardley cove was generally achieved.
