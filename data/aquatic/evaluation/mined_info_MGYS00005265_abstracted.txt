publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The association between corals and photosynthetic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.) is the key to the success of reef ecosystems in highly oligotrophic environments, but it is also their Achilles' heel due to its vulnerability to local stressors and the effects of climate change. Research during the last two decades has shaped a view that coral host-Symbiodinium pairings are diverse, but largely exclusive. Deep sequencing has now revealed the existence of a rare diversity of cryptic Symbiodinium assemblages within the coral holobiont, in addition to one or a few abundant algal members. While the contribution of the most abundant resident Symbiodinium species to coral physiology is widely recognized, the significance of the rare and low abundant background Symbiodinium remains a matter of debate. In this study, we assessed how coral-Symbiodinium communities assemble and how rare and abundant components together constitute the Symbiodinium community by analyzing 892 coral samples comprising &gt;110 000 unique Symbiodinium ITS2 marker gene sequences. Using network modeling, we show that host-Symbiodinium communities assemble in non-random 'clusters' of abundant and rare symbionts. Symbiodinium community structure follows the same principles as bacterial communities, for which the functional significance of rare members (the 'rare bacterial biosphere') has long been recognized. Importantly, the inclusion of rare Symbiodinium taxa in robustness analyses revealed a significant contribution to the stability of the host-symbiont community overall. As such, it highlights the potential functions rare symbionts may provide to environmental resilience of the coral holobiont.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Coral reefs rely on the symbiosis between scleractinian corals and intracellular, photosynthetic dinoflagellates of the genus <i>Symbiodinium</i> making the assessment of symbiont diversity critical to our understanding of ecological resilience of these ecosystems. This study characterizes <i>Symbiodinium</i> diversity around the Arabian Peninsula, which contains some of the most thermally diverse and understudied reefs on Earth. Shallow water coral reefs throughout the Red Sea (RS), Sea of Oman (SO), and Persian/Arabian Gulf (PAG). Next-generation sequencing of the ITS2 marker gene was used to assess <i>Symbiodinium</i> community composition and diversity comprising 892 samples from 46 hard and soft coral genera. Corals were associated with a large diversity of <i>Symbiodinium</i>, which usually consisted of one or two prevalent symbiont types and many types at low abundance. <i>Symbiodinium</i> communities were strongly structured according to geographical region and to a lesser extent by coral host identity. Overall symbiont communities were composed primarily of species from clade A and C in the RS, clade A, C, and D in the SO, and clade C and D in the PAG, representing a gradual shift from C- to D-dominated coral hosts. The analysis of symbiont diversity in an Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU)-based framework allowed the identification of differences in symbiont taxon richness over geographical regions and host genera. Our study represents a comprehensive overview over biogeography and molecular diversity of <i>Symbiodinium</i> in the Arabian Seas, where coral reefs thrive in one of the most extreme environmental settings on the planet. As such our data will serve as a baseline for further exploration into the effects of environmental change on host-symbiont pairings and the identification and ecological significance of <i>Symbiodinium</i> types from regions already experiencing 'Future Ocean' conditions.
