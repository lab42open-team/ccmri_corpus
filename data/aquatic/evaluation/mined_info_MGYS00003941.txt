study_name	Epipelagic bacterial communities of Canadian lakes
study_abstract	The NSERC Canadian LakePulse Network is a scientific initiative assessing environmental issues affecting Canadian lakes. Through multidisciplinary projects, LakePulse researchers use tools in lake science, spatial modelling, analytical chemistry, public health, and remote sensing to assess the status of over 600 lakes across various ecozones in Canada. The impacts of land-use, climate change and contaminants on lake health will be assessed to develop policies for better lake management.
