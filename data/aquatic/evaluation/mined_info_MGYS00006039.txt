study_name	Metagenomics insights into Phylogenetic and Functional Diversity of Halophilic Communities inhabiting solar saltern in North Sinai, Egypt
study_abstract	In tropical and subtropical areas around the world, Solar Salterns are artificial shallowponds used to manufacture halite (NaCl) from seawater. Multi-pond systems arecommonly used to make them. Saline environments ranging from intermediate tohyper-saline water (brine) and sediment, the later are characteristic of solar saltern inNorth Sinai. Metagenomics by 16S rRNA Illumina amplicon sequencing andbioinformatical analysis was used to explore the microbial diversity of Solar Salternand the halophilic communities were characterized. A total of 237,899 (brine) and59,680 (sediment) reads were collected. A microbiome featuring Archaea wasdiscovered using 16S rRNA sequencing (20% from brine and 0.28% from sediment)The domain Archaea (20%) comprising phylum Euryarchaeota (19.9%) was the mostabundant, followed by Crenarchaeota (0.02%) and Thaumarchaeota (0.01%), whiledomain Eubacteria (13.37%) included phylum Proteobacteria (4.5%), Bacteroidetes(3.7%), Actinobacteria (3.4%), and Firmicutes (3.3%). Eukarya was (1.68%) andunclassified (64.23%). In sediment Bacteria and Eukarya diversity higher than thosein brine was (47.8%) and (3.38%) respectively, domain Archaea was (0.28%) andunclassified (48.23%). The study of halophilic microorganisms in solar saltern shedslight on species that contribute to the ecosystem's biogeochemical cycles. This studypresents a first snapshot for halophilic communities in a hypersaline environment in north Sinai.
