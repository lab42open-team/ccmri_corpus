study_name	EMG produced TPA metagenomics assembly of PRJNA311332 data set (Bacteria isolated from carboxylate platform fermentations inoculated with microbial communities from extreme environments.).
study_abstract	The Third Party Annotation (TPA) assembly was derived from the primary whole genome shotgun (WGS) data set PRJNA311332, and was assembled with metaSPAdes v3.14.1. This project includes samples from the following biomes: root:Environmental:Terrestrial:Soil.
