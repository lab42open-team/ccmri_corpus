study_name	Biogeography of coastal wetland bacterial communities experiencing sudden vegetation dieoff
study_abstract	This study aims to describe how sediment microbial communities respond to the loss of vegetation through sudden vegetation die off (SVD) in two geographically separated wetlands. Further, samples were collected in the summer and fall to characterize temporal dynamics of the communities.
