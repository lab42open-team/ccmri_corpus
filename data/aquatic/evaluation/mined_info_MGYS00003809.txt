study_name	Bioturbating shrimp alter the structure and diversity of bacterial communities in coastal marine sediments
study_abstract	Investigation into the effects of ocean acidification on microbial community structure and diversity in bioturbated coastal marine sediments. Samples taken from surface sediments and sediment from the burrow walls of Upogebia deltaura, a bioturbating shrimp species. Sediments were subjected to 5 different pH levels over a 14-week exposure period. Bacterial and archaeal 16S genes were sequenced.
