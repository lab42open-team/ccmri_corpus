study_name	Bacterial communities from Thrombolites of Lake Sarmiento
study_abstract	The aim of this study was to examine the bacterial diversity of field (lived) versus cultured (kept in an aquarium system) thrombolites from Sarmineto Lake by sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. We attempt to reveal the chemical composition (before and after culturing) of our samples and to compare the bacterial populations founded with those from worldwide sites where microbialites thrive, in order to discern bacterial communities drivers within similar ecosystems.
