study_name	Prokaryotic community structure in the deep Southwest Indian Ocean with an emphasis on actinobacteria Targeted Locus (Loci)
study_abstract	Knowledge about the biodiversity extent and biogeography of deep-sea microorganisms is far from adequate. Due to its remote location, the related investigations of the Southwest Indian Ocean (SWIR) remaine extremely difficult and the microbial diversity at the SWIR has rarely been studied. Only two studies got limited numbers of 16S rRNA gene sequences, and much more in-depth sequencing efforts to evaluate the abundance and diversity of prokaryotes at the SWIR are still needed. In this study, pyrosequencing was used to investigate the community structure and biogeography of prokaryotes, especially actinobacteria, in the deep SWIR. It also identified the factors in contributing to the distribution of the prokaryotes and actinobacteria, the historical contingencies, contemporary environmental factors, or both? The results would provide further insights on the prokaryotic, especially actinobacterial community structure at the SWIR and help to understand the underling mechanisms of the microbial distribution in the deep ocean. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the biodiversity and biogeography of actinobacteria at the SWIR.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The phylum Actinobacteria has been reported to be common or even abundant in deep marine sediments, however, knowledge about the diversity, distribution, and function of actinobacteria is limited. In this study, actinobacterial diversity in the deep sea along the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) was investigated using both 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and culture-based methods. The samples were collected at depths of 1662-4000 m below water surface. Actinobacterial sequences represented 1.2-9.1% of all microbial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences in each sample. A total of 5 actinobacterial classes, 17 orders, 28 families, and 52 genera were detected by pyrosequencing, dominated by the classes Acidimicrobiia and Actinobacteria. Differences in actinobacterial community compositions were found among the samples. The community structure showed significant correlations to geochemical factors, notably pH, calcium, total organic carbon, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen, rather than to spatial distance at the scale of the investigation. In addition, 176 strains of the Actinobacteria class, belonging to 9 known orders, 18 families, and 29 genera, were isolated. Among these cultivated taxa, 8 orders, 13 families, and 15 genera were also recovered by pyrosequencing. At a 97% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the pyrosequencing data encompassed 77.3% of the isolates but the isolates represented only 10.3% of the actinobacterial reads. Phylogenetic analysis of all the representative actinobacterial sequences and isolates indicated that at least four new orders within the phylum Actinobacteria were detected by pyrosequencing. More than half of the isolates spanning 23 genera and all samples demonstrated activity in the degradation of refractory organics, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polysaccharides, suggesting their potential ecological functions and biotechnological applications for carbon recycling.
