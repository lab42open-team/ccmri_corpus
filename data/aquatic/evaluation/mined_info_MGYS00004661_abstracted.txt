publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The compatible solute dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), made by many marine organisms, is one of Earth's most abundant organosulfur molecules. Many marine bacteria import DMSP and can degrade it as a source of carbon and/or sulfur via DMSP cleavage or DMSP demethylation pathways, which can generate the climate active gases dimethyl sulfide (DMS) or methanthiol (MeSH), respectively. Here we used culture-dependent and -independent methods to study bacteria catabolizing DMSP in the East China Sea (ECS). Of bacterial isolates, 42.11% showed DMSP-dependent DMS (Ddd<sup>+</sup>) activity, and 12.28% produced detectable levels of MeSH. Interestingly, although most Ddd<sup>+</sup> isolates were <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> (mainly Roseobacters), many gram-positive <i>Actinobacteria</i> were also shown to cleave DMSP producing DMS. The mechanism by which these <i>Actinobacteria</i> cleave DMSP is unknown, since no known functional <i>ddd</i> genes have been identified in genome sequences of Ddd<sup>+</sup> <i>Microbacterium</i> and <i>Agrococcus</i> isolates or in any other sequenced <i>Actinobacteria</i> genomes. Gene probes to the DMSP demethylation gene <i>dmdA</i> and the DMSP lyase gene <i>dddP</i> demonstrated that these DMSP-degrading genes are abundant and widely distributed in ECS seawaters. <i>dmdA</i> was present in relatively high proportions in both surface (19.53% +/- 6.70%) and bottom seawater bacteria (16.00% +/- 8.73%). In contrast, <i>dddP</i> abundance positively correlated with chlorophyll <i>a</i>, and gradually decreased with the distance from land, which implies that the bacterial DMSP lyase gene <i>dddP</i> might be from bacterial groups that closely associate with phytoplankton. Bacterial community analysis showed positive correlations between <i>Rhodobacteraceae</i> abundance and concentrations of DMS and DMSP, further confirming the link between this abundant bacterial class and the environmental DMSP cycling.
