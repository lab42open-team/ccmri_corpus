study_name	Incubation of marine methane seep sediments with a bioorthogonal amino acid
study_abstract	In marine sediments, anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is primarily catalyzed by syntrophic consortia of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). We applied bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) using a high-throughput approach to detecting protein synthesis in individual cells, on sediments from deep-sea methane seeps. Sediment samples have been incubated in the presence or absence of methane and a bioorthogonal amino acid. V6 regions of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified using general primers, tagged, and analyzed for shifts in the microbial community during time of incubation.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	To understand the biogeochemical roles of microorganisms in the environment, it is important to determine when and under which conditions they are metabolically active. Bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) can reveal active cells by tracking the incorporation of synthetic amino acids into newly synthesized proteins. The phylogenetic identity of translationally active cells can be determined by combining BONCAT with rRNA-targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization (BONCAT-FISH). In theory, BONCAT-labeled cells could be isolated with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BONCAT-FACS) for subsequent genetic analyses. Here, in the first application, to our knowledge, of BONCAT-FISH and BONCAT-FACS within an environmental context, we probe the translational activity of microbial consortia catalyzing the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), a dominant sink of methane in the ocean. These consortia, which typically are composed of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria, have been difficult to study due to their slow in situ growth rates, and fundamental questions remain about their ecology and diversity of interactions occurring between ANME and associated partners. Our activity-correlated analyses of &gt;16,400 microbial aggregates provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that AOM consortia affiliated with all five major ANME clades are concurrently active under controlled conditions. Surprisingly, sorting of individual BONCAT-labeled consortia followed by whole-genome amplification and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed previously unrecognized interactions of ANME with members of the poorly understood phylum Verrucomicrobia This finding, together with our observation that ANME-associated Verrucomicrobia are found in a variety of geographically distinct methane seep environments, suggests a broader range of symbiotic relationships within AOM consortia than previously thought.
