study_name	Preservation of ancient eukaryotic DNA in methane hydrate-associated marine sediments.
study_abstract	Ancient eukaryotic DNA in marine sediment can provide valuable information on the paleo-environment. However, labile nucleic acids are generally considered to be microbially degraded in water and sediment columns. Previously, ancient eukaryotic DNA has been retrieved from sediments associated with anoxic water column in lake and semi-closed sea, due to the minimized effect of oxic biodegradation. Cold seep sediment is characterized by high upward flux of methane, where there is the possibility that the excess energy source might suppress the degradation of deposited organic matter including nucleic acids by microbial activity. We investigated the preservation of ancient eukaryotic DNA in marine sediments associated with and without methane hydrate in the eastern Japan Sea, between which the dominant prokaryotic populations are clearly distinct. Marine sediments were retrieved from the eastern Japan Sea during a cruise onboard R/V Marion Dufresne in June 2010. Two-step alkaline DNA extractions were conducted with 0.1 g of marine sediments. DNA from living organisms such as fungi was removed by the first extraction under mildly heated conditions at 65 degrees Celsius, which was followed by the second extraction at 95 degrees Celsius. Triplicate DNA extraction and subsequent clone library analysis were more reproducible for marine sediments associated with methane hydrate. Based on highly variable18S rRNA gene sequences, terrestrial and marine organisms were taxonomically identified at the species level. The diversity of ancient eukaryotic DNA represented by Alveolata, Fungi, Stramenopiles and Viridiplantae was comparable between this study and previous ones. As only 0.1g of g wet sediment is required, the overall methodology developed in this study has great potential to reconstruct terrestrial and marine ecology at high time resolution. In addition, methane hydrate-associated sediments, which are globally distributed along the continental margin, have great potential to reconstruct the past terrestrial and marine ecology around the world over geological timescales.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Marine sediments contain eukaryotic DNA deposited from overlying water columns. However, a large proportion of deposited eukaryotic DNA is aerobically biodegraded in shallow marine sediments. Cold seep sediments are often anaerobic near the sediment-water interface, so eukaryotic DNA in such sediments is expected to be preserved. We investigated deeply buried marine sediments in the Japan Sea, where a methane hydrate deposit is associated with cold seeps. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed the reproducible recovery of eukaryotic DNA in marine sediments at depths up to 31.0 m in the vicinity of the methane hydrate deposit. In contrast, the reproducible recovery of eukaryotic DNA was limited to a shallow depth (8.3 m) in marine sediments not adjacent to the methane hydrate deposit in the same area. Pyrosequencing of an 18S rRNA gene variable region generated 1,276-3,307 reads per sample, which was sufficient to cover the biodiversity based on rarefaction curves. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the eukaryotic DNA originated from radiolarian genera of the class Chaunacanthida, which have SrSO<sub>4</sub> skeletons, the sea grass genus Zostera, and the seaweed genus Sargassum. Eukaryotic DNA originating from other planktonic fauna and land plants was also detected. Diatom sequences closely related to Thalassiosira spp., indicative of cold climates, were obtained from sediments deposited during the last glacial period (MIS-2). Plant sequences of the genera Alnus, Micromonas, and Ulmus were found in sediments deposited during the warm interstadial period (MIS-3). These results suggest the long-term persistence of eukaryotic DNA from terrestrial and aquatic sources in marine sediments associated with cold seeps, and that the genetic information from eukaryotic DNA from deeply buried marine sediments associated with cold seeps can be used to reconstruct environments and ecosystems from the past.
