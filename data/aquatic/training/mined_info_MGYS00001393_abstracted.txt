study_name	Sedimentary DNA reveals cyanobacterial community diversity over 200 years in two perialpine lakes
study_abstract	We present a method for reconstructing past cyanobacterial communities using a temporally high resolved genetic approach on sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) from two stratified peri-alpine lakes in Switzerland (Lake Greifensee and Lake Zurich). We successfully sequenced a 400 nucleotides-long amplicon in the 16S rRNA gene using high-throughput sequencing. The amplicons were used to build a phylogeny summarizing the diversity over the past 200 years in the two lakes. Sequencing revealed a high diversity of cyanobacteria in both lakes. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) spanned the whole phylum Cyanobacteria and included representatives of a newly described line of bacteria termed Malainabacteria which share common ancestry with cyanobacteria, and have not been previously reported in lakes. The sequencing data was validated using a dataset comprising of 40 years of pelagic phytoplankton microscopic identification from each lake. Common taxa identified in the pelagic samples were also recovered from the sediments. The linear model confirmed a strong and significant relationship (R2=0.86) between pelagic species richness estimated by microscopy and OTU richness from the sediments. The slope for each lake was close to the 1:1 line, but the diversity derived from the sedDNA had a higher baseline compared to microscopy. The water-sediments richness relationship differed among cyanobacterial orders, revealing that diversity of Chroococcales and Synechococcales was widely underestimated by microscopy. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for the reconstruction of past cyanobacterial pelagic communities using lake sedDNA, and its potential for exploring variation in phylogenetic diversity and community structure over long-term lake historical changes.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	We reconstructed cyanobacterial community structure and phylogeny using DNA that was isolated from layers of stratified sediments spanning 200 years of lake history in the perialpine lakes Greifensee and Lake Zurich (Switzerland). Community analysis based on amplification and sequencing of a 400-nucleotide (nt)-long 16S rRNA fragment specific to Cyanobacteria revealed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) capturing the whole phylum, including representatives of a newly characterized clade termed Melainabacteria, which shares common ancestry with Cyanobacteria and has not been previously described in lakes. The reconstruction of cyanobacterial richness and phylogenetic structure was validated using a data set consisting of 40 years of pelagic microscopic counts from each lake. We identified the OTUs assigned to common taxa known to be present in Greifensee and Lake Zurich and found a strong and significant relationship (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.89; P &lt; 0.001) between pelagic species richness in water and OTU richness in the sediments. The water-sediment richness relationship varied between cyanobacterial orders, indicating that the richness of Chroococcales and Synechococcales may be underestimated by microscopy. PCR detection of the microcystin synthetase gene mcyA confirmed the presence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial taxa over recent years in Greifensee and throughout the last century in Lake Zurich. The approach presented in this study demonstrates that it is possible to reconstruct past pelagic cyanobacterial communities in lakes where the integrity of the sedimentary archive is well preserved and to explore changes in phylogenetic and functional diversity over decade-to-century timescales. Cyanobacterial blooms can produce toxins that affect water quality, especially under eutrophic conditions, which are a consequence of human-induced climate warming and increased nutrient availability. Lakes worldwide have suffered from regular cyanobacterial blooms over the last century. The lack of long-term data limits our understanding of how these blooms form. We successfully reconstructed the past diversity of whole cyanobacterial communities over two hundred years by sequencing genes preserved in the sediments of two perialpine lakes in Switzerland. We identified changes in diversity over time and validated our results using existing data collected in the same two lakes over the past 40 years. This work shows the potential of our approach for addressing important ecological questions about the effects of a changing environment on lake ecology.
