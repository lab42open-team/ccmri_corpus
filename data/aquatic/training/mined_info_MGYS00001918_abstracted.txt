publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The rise of antibiotic resistance (AR) in clinical settings is of great concern. Therefore, the understanding of AR mechanisms, evolution, and global distribution is a priority for patient survival. Despite all efforts in the elucidation of AR mechanisms in clinical strains, little is known about its prevalence and evolution in environmental microorganisms. We used 293 metagenomic samples from the TARA Oceans project to detect and quantify environmental antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) using machine learning tools. After manual curation of ARGs, their abundance and distribution in the global ocean are presented. Additionally, the potential of horizontal ARG transfer by plasmids and their correlation with environmental and geographical parameters is shown. A total of 99,205 environmental open reading frames (ORFs) were classified as 1 of 560 different ARGs conferring resistance to 26 antibiotic classes. We found 24,567 ORFs in putative plasmid sequences, suggesting the importance of mobile genetic elements in the dynamics of environmental ARG transmission. Moreover, 4,804 contigs with &gt;=2 putative ARGs were found, including 2 plasmid-like contigs with 5 different ARGs, highlighting the potential presence of multi-resistant microorganisms in the natural ocean environment. Finally, we identified ARGs conferring resistance to some of the most relevant clinical antibiotics, revealing the presence of 15 ARGs similar to mobilized colistin resistance genes (mcr) with high abundance on polar biomes. Of these, 5 are assigned to Psychrobacter, a genus including opportunistic human pathogens. This study uncovers the diversity and abundance of ARGs in the global ocean metagenome. Our results are available on Zenodo in MySQL database dump format, and all the code used for the analyses, including a Jupyter notebook js avaliable on Github. We also developed a dashboard web application (http://www.resistomedb.com) for data visualization.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Viruses are important components of microbial communities modulating community structure and function; however, only a couple of tools are currently available for phage identification and analysis from metagenomic sequencing data. Here we employed the random forest algorithm to develop VirMiner, a web-based phage contig prediction tool especially sensitive for high-abundances phage contigs, trained and validated by paired metagenomic and phagenomic sequencing data from the human gut flora. VirMiner achieved 41.06% +/- 17.51% sensitivity and 81.91% +/- 4.04% specificity in the prediction of phage contigs. In particular, for the high-abundance phage contigs, VirMiner outperformed other tools (VirFinder and VirSorter) with much higher sensitivity (65.23% +/- 16.94%) than VirFinder (34.63% +/- 17.96%) and VirSorter (18.75% +/- 15.23%) at almost the same specificity. Moreover, VirMiner provides the most comprehensive phage analysis pipeline which is comprised of metagenomic raw reads processing, functional annotation, phage contig identification, and phage-host relationship prediction (CRISPR-spacer recognition) and supports two-group comparison when the input (metagenomic sequence data) includes different conditions (e.g., case and control). Application of VirMiner to an independent cohort of human gut metagenomes obtained from individuals treated with antibiotics revealed that 122 KEGG orthology and 118 Pfam groups had significantly differential abundance in the pre-treatment samples compared to samples at the end of antibiotic administration, including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), multidrug resistance, and protein transport. The VirMiner webserver is available at http://sbb.hku.hk/VirMiner/ . We developed a comprehensive tool for phage prediction and analysis for metagenomic samples. Compared to VirSorter and VirFinder-the most widely used tools-VirMiner is able to capture more high-abundance phage contigs which could play key roles in infecting bacteria and modulating microbial community dynamics.

publication_nr_2_pubmed_abstract	Bacteriophages are widely considered to influence bacterial communities, however most phages are still unknown or not studied well enough to understand their ecological roles. We have isolated two phages infecting Lentibacter sp. SH36, affiliated with the marine Roseobacter group, and retrieved similar phage genomes from publicly available metagenomics databases. Phylogenetic analysis placed the new phages within the Cobavirus group, in the here newly proposed genus Siovirus and subfamily Riovirinae of the Podoviridae. Gene composition and presence of direct terminal repeats in cultivated cobaviruses point toward a genome replication and packaging strategy similar to the T7 phage. Investigation of the genomes suggests that viral lysis of the cell proceeds via the canonical holin-endolysin pathway. Cobaviral hosts include members of the genera Lentibacter, Sulfitobacter and Celeribacter of the Roseobacter group within the family Rhodobacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria). Screening more than 5,000 marine metagenomes, we found cobaviruses worldwide from temperate to tropical waters, in the euphotic zone, mainly in bays and estuaries, but also in the open ocean. The presence of cobaviruses in protist metagenomes as well as the phylogenetic neighborhood of cobaviruses in glutaredoxin and ribonucleotide reductase trees suggest that cobaviruses could infect bacteria associated with phototrophic or grazing protists. With this study, we expand the understanding of the phylogeny, classification, genomic organization, biogeography and ecology of this phage group infecting marine Rhodobacteraceae.
