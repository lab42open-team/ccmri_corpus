study_abstract	Richmond Mine acid mine drainage biofilm samples datasets (2006-2010). This project describes a population genomic study focused on determining the evolutionary rates in natural populations, and to correlate human disturbance to major evolutionary divergence events. Biofilm samples from acid mine drainage were taken in the period 2006-2010 at four locations in the Richmond Mine (Iron Mt., CA). Community genomic DNA was extracted and sequenced by either 454 or Illumina sequencing.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Few data are available on how quickly free-living microorganisms evolve. We analyzed biofilms collected from a well-defined acid mine drainage system over 9 years to investigate the processes and determine rates of bacterial evolution directly in the environment. Population metagenomic analyses of the dominant primary producer yielded the nucleotide substitution rate, which we used to show that proliferation of a series of recombinant bacterial strains occurred over the past few decades. The ecological success of hybrid bacterial types highlights the role of evolutionary processes in rapid adaptation within natural microbial communities.
