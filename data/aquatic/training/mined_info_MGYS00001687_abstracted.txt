study_abstract	Microbial communities at high altitude ecosystem spring sites, are subjected along the day to extreme changes in irradiation and temperature. Herein, we determined the composition of actively transcribing bacteria from spring waters through 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing (cDNA) experimentally exposed along the day (morning, noon and afternoon) to variable solar radiation and light quality, and evaluated their influence on nutrients recycling. Irradiation, temperature and nutrients rates of change were associated with changes in the active bacterial community structure, predominantly conformed by Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and other 35 Phyla including also the recently described Candidate Phyla Radiation (e.g., Parcubacteria, Gracilibacteria, OP3, TM6, SR1). An increase of diversity was observed at noon when the highest irradiances were measured (3.3 -3.9 H', 1125 W m-2) compared to morning and afternoon (0.6-2.8 H'). These increase was associated with a decrease of Cyanobacteria and an enhancement of Proteobacteria and initially low frequently and rare bacteria phyla (<0.5% sequences contribution). UV radiation compared to full sun radiation indicates the presence of a higher number of stimulatory compared to inhibitory effects, including contrasting responses of some Orders, e.g., positive effects were found for Cyanobacteria, Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Bacteroidales; whereas negative effects for the orders Oceanospirillales, Fibrobacterales, Alteromonadales and Sphingobacteriales. Nutrient recycling was influenced by microbial composition changes, particularly for Cyanobacteria, nitrifying bacteria and Chlorobi. In total, our results indicate that phototrophic bacteria from high altitude aquatic ecosystems were affected but potentially resilient to the negative effect of high solar radiation influencing nutrient recycling in these ecosystems.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Microbial communities inhabiting high-altitude spring ecosystems are subjected to extreme changes in solar irradiance and temperature throughout the diel cycle. Here, using 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing (cDNA) we determined the composition of actively transcribing bacteria from spring waters experimentally exposed through the day (morning, noon, and afternoon) to variable levels of solar radiation and light quality, and evaluated their influence on nutrient recycling. Solar irradiance, temperature, and changes in nutrient dynamics were associated with changes in the active bacterial community structure, predominantly by Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and 35 other Phyla, including the recently described Candidate Phyla Radiation (e.g., Parcubacteria, Gracilibacteria, OP3, TM6, SR1). Diversity increased at noon, when the highest irradiances were measured (3.3-3.9 H', 1125 W m<sup>-2</sup>) compared to morning and afternoon (0.6-2.8 H'). This shift was associated with a decrease in the contribution to pyrolibraries by Cyanobacteria and an increase of Proteobacteria and other initially low frequently and rare bacteria phyla (&lt; 0.5%) in the pyrolibraries. A potential increase in the activity of Cyanobacteria and other phototrophic groups, e.g., Rhodobacterales, was observed and associated with UVR, suggesting the presence of photo-activated repair mechanisms to resist high levels of solar radiation. In addition, the percentage contribution of cyanobacterial sequences in the afternoon was similar to those recorded in the morning. The shifts in the contribution by Cyanobacteria also influenced the rate of change in nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate, highlighted by a high level of nitrate accumulation during hours of high radiation and temperature associated with nitrifying bacteria activity. We did not detect ammonia or nitrite oxidizing bacteria <i>in situ</i>, but both functional groups (<i>Nitrosomona</i> and <i>Nitrospira</i>) appeared mainly in pyrolibraries generated from dark incubations. In total, our results reveal that both the structure and the diversity of the active bacteria community was extremely dynamic through the day, and showed marked shifts in composition that influenced nutrient recycling, highlighting how abiotic variation affects potential ecosystem functioning.
