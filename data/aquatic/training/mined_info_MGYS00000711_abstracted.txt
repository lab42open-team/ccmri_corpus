study_name	Comparative metagenomics of microbial communities in gorgonian corals, marine sediments and seawater
study_abstract	The sustainability of coral reefs bears fundamental implications to the functioning of coastal ecosystems and the biogeochemistry of our planet. The coral-associated microbiota plays a pivotal role as a fitness-enhancing factor in the survivability and persistence of the coral holobiont in marine biomes. Nevertheless, we currently lack knowledge of the taxonomy and functional traits of the highly complex microbiome that populates most coral species. Conspicuously, symbionts inhabiting soft corals which usually thrive and dominate in temperate waters have been scarcely examined. In this study, we employ a comparative metagenomics approach to uncover the distinct phylogenetic and functional features of the microbiome of soft corals. To this end, high-throughput, Illumina metagenome sequencing of seawater, sediments and of the symbiotic consortium from the gorgonian corals Eunicella verrucosa, Eunicella gazella and Leptogorgia sarmentosa was performed.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	In octocorals (Cnidaria Octocorallia), the functional relationship between host health and its symbiotic consortium has yet to be determined. Here, we employed comparative metagenomics to uncover the distinct functional and phylogenetic features of the microbiomes of healthy Eunicella gazella, Eunicella verrucosa, and Leptogorgia sarmentosa tissues, in contrast with the microbiomes found in seawater and sediments. We further explored how the octocoral microbiome shifts to a pathobiome state in E. gazella. Multivariate analyses based on 16S rRNA genes, Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs), Protein families (Pfams), and secondary metabolite-biosynthetic gene clusters annotated from 20 Illumina-sequenced metagenomes each revealed separate clustering of the prokaryotic communities of healthy tissue samples of the three octocoral species from those of necrotic E. gazella tissue and surrounding environments. While the healthy octocoral microbiome was distinguished by so-far uncultivated Endozoicomonadaceae, Oceanospirillales, and Alteromonadales phylotypes in all host species, a pronounced increase of Flavobacteriaceae and Alphaproteobacteria, originating from seawater, was observed in necrotic E. gazella tissue. Increased abundances of eukaryotic-like proteins, exonucleases, restriction endonucleases, CRISPR/Cas proteins, and genes encoding for heat-shock proteins, inorganic ion transport, and iron storage distinguished the prokaryotic communities of healthy octocoral tissue regardless of the host species. An increase of arginase and nitric oxide reductase genes, observed in necrotic E. gazella tissues, suggests the existence of a mechanism for suppression of nitrite oxide production by which octocoral pathogens may overcome the host's immune system. This is the first study to employ primer-less, shotgun metagenome sequencing to unveil the taxonomic, functional, and secondary metabolism features of prokaryotic communities in octocorals. Our analyses reveal that the octocoral microbiome is distinct from those of the environmental surroundings, is host genus (but not species) specific, and undergoes large, complex structural changes in the transition to the dysbiotic state. Host-symbiont recognition, abiotic-stress response, micronutrient acquisition, and an antiviral defense arsenal comprising multiple restriction endonucleases, CRISPR/Cas systems, and phage lysogenization regulators are signatures of prokaryotic communities in octocorals. We argue that these features collectively contribute to the stabilization of symbiosis in the octocoral holobiont and constitute beneficial traits that can guide future studies on coral reef conservation and microbiome therapy.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Chitin ranks as the most abundant polysaccharide in the oceans yet knowledge of shifts in structure and diversity of chitin-degrading communities across marine niches is scarce. Here, we integrate cultivation-dependent and -independent approaches to shed light on the chitin processing potential within the microbiomes of marine sponges, octocorals, sediments, and seawater. We found that cultivatable host-associated bacteria in the genera Aquimarina, Enterovibrio, Microbulbifer, Pseudoalteromonas, Shewanella, and Vibrio were able to degrade colloidal chitin in vitro. Congruent with enzymatic activity bioassays, genome-wide inspection of cultivated symbionts revealed that Vibrio and Aquimarina species, particularly, possess several endo- and exo-chitinase-encoding genes underlying their ability to cleave the large chitin polymer into oligomers and dimers. Conversely, Alphaproteobacteria species were found to specialize in the utilization of the chitin monomer N-acetylglucosamine more often. Phylogenetic assessments uncovered a high degree of within-genome diversification of multiple, full-length endo-chitinase genes for Aquimarina and Vibrio strains, suggestive of a versatile chitin catabolism aptitude. We then analyzed the abundance distributions of chitin metabolism-related genes across 30 Illumina-sequenced microbial metagenomes and found that the endosymbiotic consortium of Spongia officinalis is enriched in polysaccharide deacetylases, suggesting the ability of the marine sponge microbiome to convert chitin into its deacetylated-and biotechnologically versatile-form chitosan. Instead, the abundance of endo-chitinase and chitin-binding protein-encoding genes in healthy octocorals leveled up with those from the surrounding environment but was found to be depleted in necrotic octocoral tissue. Using cultivation-independent, taxonomic assignments of endo-chitinase encoding genes, we unveiled previously unsuspected richness and divergent structures of chitinolytic communities across host-associated and free-living biotopes, revealing putative roles for uncultivated Gammaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi symbionts in chitin processing within sessile marine invertebrates. Our findings suggest that differential chitin degradation pathways, utilization, and turnover dictate the processing of chitin across marine micro-niches and support the hypothesis that inter-species cross-feeding could facilitate the co-existence of chitin utilizers within marine invertebrate microbiomes. We further identified chitin metabolism functions which may serve as indicators of microbiome integrity/dysbiosis in corals and reveal putative novel chitinolytic enzymes in the genus Aquimarina that may find applications in the blue biotechnology sector.
