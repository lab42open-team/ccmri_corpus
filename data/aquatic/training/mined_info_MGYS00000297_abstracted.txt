study_abstract	Polar winter waters are one of the least studied marine ecosystems with regard to microbial life and Thaumarchaeota are key microorganisms in this environment. We collected data on abundance and metabolic activity of Thaumarchaeota in Arctic and Antarctic waters in different seasons, including the wintertime. As previously observed, Arctic Thaumarchaeota grew throughout the winter, increasing their abundances one order of magnitude from January to March 2008. Yet, paradoxically, in situ single-cell measurements revealed an unexpected low metabolic activity for this group in both polar systems, i.e., less than 5% of archaeal cells taking up leucine or bicarbonate, inconsistent with known heterotrophic or autotrophic archaeal lifestyles. To resolve how archaea obtain energy and carbon for growth, we analyzed a metagenome collected during the Arctic winter, when the Thaumarchaeota population was at its maximum of abundance (18% of cell counts). Metagenomics and quantitative PCR showed that archaeal amoA genes were abundant in Arctic and Antarctic waters, indicating that polar Thaumarchaeota have the potential for ammonia oxidation. The presence of a large number of archaeal genes involved in urea transport and degradation together with detectable uptake of 14C-labeled urea by the prokaryotic assemblage, suggest that the products of urea hydrolysis (NH3 and CO2) may be sources of both energy and carbon for polar ammonia oxidizing archaea. This hypothesis, consistent with the idea of polar archaea growing as nitrifiers but with apparent low incorporation of bicarbonate, would provide the molecular basis for the recurrent archaeal growth in polar winter waters.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Despite the high abundance of Archaea in the global ocean, their metabolism and biogeochemical roles remain largely unresolved. We investigated the population dynamics and metabolic activity of Thaumarchaeota in polar environments, where these microorganisms are particularly abundant and exhibit seasonal growth. Thaumarchaeota were more abundant in deep Arctic and Antarctic waters and grew throughout the winter at surface and deeper Arctic halocline waters. However, in situ single-cell activity measurements revealed a low activity of this group in the uptake of both leucine and bicarbonate (&lt;5% Thaumarchaeota cells active), which is inconsistent with known heterotrophic and autotrophic thaumarchaeal lifestyles. These results suggested the existence of alternative sources of carbon and energy. Our analysis of an environmental metagenome from the Arctic winter revealed that Thaumarchaeota had pathways for ammonia oxidation and, unexpectedly, an abundance of genes involved in urea transport and degradation. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that most polar Thaumarchaeota had the potential to oxidize ammonia, and a large fraction of them had urease genes, enabling the use of urea to fuel nitrification. Thaumarchaeota from Arctic deep waters had a higher abundance of urease genes than those near the surface suggesting genetic differences between closely related archaeal populations. In situ measurements of urea uptake and concentration in Arctic waters showed that small-sized prokaryotes incorporated the carbon from urea, and the availability of urea was often higher than that of ammonium. Therefore, the degradation of urea may be a relevant pathway for Thaumarchaeota and other microorganisms exposed to the low-energy conditions of dark polar waters.
