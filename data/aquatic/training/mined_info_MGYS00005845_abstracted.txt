study_abstract	Nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing bacteria are widespread in the environment contribute to nitrate removal and influence the fate of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. The autotrophic growth of nitrate-reducing iron(II)-oxidizing bacteria is rarely investigated and poorly understood. The most prominent model system for this type of studies is enrichment culture KS, which originates from a freshwater sediment in Bremen, Germany. To gain insights in the metabolism of nitrate reduction coupled to iron(II) oxidation under in the absence of organic carbon and oxygen limited conditions, we performed metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic analyses of culture KS.This dataset contains: (1) Raw sequencing data of 16S (V4 region, primers 515f and 806r) rRNA amplicon sequencing of the microbial community composition of the autotrophic NRFeOx enrichment culture KS. Illumina MiSeq sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using PE 250 bp MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (500 cycles kit) were performed at Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland). (2) Raw sequencing data of shotgun metagenomics. For short reads, library was prepared with TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Kit (Illumina) and sequenced with PE 150 bp on a NovaSeq 6000 totalling 55 and 48 Gbp by CeGaT, Tuebingen, Germany. For long read sequencing, library preparation with ONT Native Ligation Kit was followed by sequencing with PromethION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) flow cell (version 9.4.1) for 72h with standard settings (basecalling with HAC mode, bias voltage -180 mV) yielding 53 Gbp in 5 million reads by the NGS Competence Center Tuebingen (NCCT) of the University of Tuebingen, Germany. (3) Short and long reads were assembled with metaSPAdes v3.13.1 using https://github.com/nf-core/mag v1.0.0. (4) Raw sequencing data of shotgun metatranscriptomes (2 conditions, triplicates). Library preparation including bacterial ribodepletion (NuGen Universal Prokaryotic RNA-Seq kit incl. bacterial ribodepletion) and Illumina NextSeq v2.5 sequencing with PE 75 bp and 21 to 62 Mio clusters per sample were performed by Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland).

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Nitrate reduction coupled to Fe(II) oxidation (NRFO) has been recognized as an environmentally important microbial process in many freshwater ecosystems. However, well-characterized examples of autotrophic nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria are rare, and their pathway of electron transfer as well as their interaction with flanking community members remain largely unknown. Here, we applied meta-omics (i.e., metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics) to the nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing enrichment culture KS growing under autotrophic or heterotrophic conditions and originating from freshwater sediment. We constructed four metagenome-assembled genomes with an estimated completeness of >=95%, including the key players of NRFO in culture KS, identified as <i>Gallionellaceae</i> sp. and <i>Rhodanobacter</i> sp. The <i>Gallionellaceae</i> sp. and <i>Rhodanobacter</i> sp. transcripts and proteins likely involved in Fe(II) oxidation (e.g., <i>mtoAB</i>, <i>cyc2</i>, and <i>mofA</i>), denitrification (e.g., <i>napGHI</i>), and oxidative phosphorylation (e.g., respiratory chain complexes I to V) along with <i>Gallionellaceae</i> sp. transcripts and proteins for carbon fixation (e.g., <i>rbcL</i>) were detected. Overall, our results indicate that in culture KS, the <i>Gallionellaceae</i> sp. and <i>Rhodanobacter</i> sp. are interdependent: while <i>Gallionellaceae</i> sp. fixes CO<sub>2</sub> and provides organic compounds for <i>Rhodanobacter</i> sp., <i>Rhodanobacter</i> sp. likely detoxifies NO through NO reduction and completes denitrification, which cannot be performed by <i>Gallionellaceae</i> sp. alone. Additionally, the transcripts and partial proteins of <i>cbb<sub>3</sub></i>- and <i>aa<sub>3</sub></i>-type cytochrome <i>c</i> suggest the possibility for a microaerophilic lifestyle of the <i>Gallionellaceae</i> sp., yet culture KS grows under anoxic conditions. Our findings demonstrate that autotrophic NRFO is performed through cooperation among denitrifying and Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, which might resemble microbial interactions in freshwater environments. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria are widespread in the environment, contribute to nitrate removal, and influence the fate of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. The autotrophic growth of nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria is rarely investigated and not fully understood. The most prominent model system for this type of study is the enrichment culture KS. To gain insights into the metabolism of nitrate reduction coupled to Fe(II) oxidation in the absence of organic carbon and oxygen, we performed metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic analyses of culture KS and identified <i>Gallionellaceae</i> sp. and <i>Rhodanobacter</i> sp. as interdependent key Fe(II) oxidizers in culture KS. Our work demonstrates that autotrophic nitrate reduction coupled to Fe(II) oxidation is not performed by an individual strain but is a cooperation of at least two members of the bacterial community in culture KS. These findings serve as a foundation for our understanding of nitrate-reducing Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria in the environment.
