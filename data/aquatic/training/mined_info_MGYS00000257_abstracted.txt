study_abstract	Here we present a multi-omic study of the Bacterial and Archaeal diversity found at the L4 long-term marine observatory. We have previously generated a six year time series from L4 that showed that the bacterial community shows strong seasonal structuring and diversity peaks every year on the winter solstice. Here we further confirm this pattern by extending this study to include genes and transcripts generated for eight additional time points in 2008. This data includes further 16S datasets as well as eight metagenomes (1.2 GB) and eight metatranscriptomes (157MB). These time points cover three seasons (Jan, April and August) and include day and night (diel) publicSamples. In addition, the August publicSamples (4) include 4 consecutive samplings within 24 hours at six hour intervals. Using these data we test whether Archaea also show the same observed seasonal patterns and whether these patterns hold true at the gene (functional) level. Analysis of this combined data set allows five main conclusions to be drawn. First, Archaea show evidence of following the same seasonal patterns as Bacteria, but have ~6% the richness. Second, for both Bacteria and Archaea, we confirm that higher 16S diversity reflects higher diversity at the gene-level (including expressed genes) and this diversity also peaks at the winter solstice. Third, interestingly, detectable diversity appears to be higher at night, and this is of special potential relevance as there is more diversity in winter when nights are longer. Fourth, despite the diversity of these communities, night and day publicSamples taken using Lagrangian (drift) sampling were successful in isolating the same community suggesting communities are more structured than is commonly believed. Finally, this data, as expected, contains a large proportion of orphan genes without known homologues. When compared to the housekeeping genes identified through SEED subsystem classification, these unknown genes appear to be driving the differences between publicSamples across seasons. This underscores the importance of determining the functions of more of these sequences in the future. In summary, this study further confirms the strong seasonal patterns characterizing both the bacterial and archaeal communities at this important marine site. The finding that, despite the huge diversity of these communities, there are evident signs of predictable patterns and detectable stability over time provides compelling evidence that renewed efforts should be focused on finding deterministic patterns in even the most complex microbial communities. The Western Channel Observatory maintains more than 100 years of continual environmental monitoring, including oceanographic and biological measures. At PML we are committed to developing this outstanding time series to include the most up to date techniques available. Our aim is to provide an holistic ecologically relevant dataset that can be used to inform environmental models and help with prediction of the impact that climate change will have on the coastal seas of the United Kingdom. With further development and comparative publicStudies this information can help to inform on global marine environments. To this end we have been employing the latest in high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate the microbial diversity and community function in this ecosystem. The technologies applied include 16S rDNA tag-pyrosequencing to deep sequence microbial diversity, as well as total community metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. This initial study includes 16S rDNA tag sequencing data for bacteria and archaeal groups as well as metagenomics and metatranscriptomics all performed on the GS-flx titanium platform using techniques outlined in Gilbert et al (2009 – Environmental Microbiology) and Gilbert et al (2008 – PloS One.) We will continue to add to this repository to maintain the temporal analysis of this community.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The world's oceans are home to a diverse array of microbial life whose metabolic activity helps to drive the earth's biogeochemical cycles. Metagenomic analysis has revolutionized our access to these communities, providing a system-scale perspective of microbial community interactions. However, while metagenome sequencing can provide useful estimates of the relative change in abundance of specific genes and taxa between environments or over time, this does not investigate the relative changes in the production or consumption of different metabolites. We propose a methodology, Predicted Relative Metabolic Turnover (PRMT) that defines and enables exploration of metabolite-space inferred from the metagenome. Our analysis of metagenomic data from a time-series study in the Western English Channel demonstrated considerable correlations between predicted relative metabolic turnover and seasonal changes in abundance of measured environmental parameters as well as with observed seasonal changes in bacterial population structure. The PRMT method was successfully applied to metagenomic data to explore the Western English Channel microbial metabalome to generate specific, biologically testable hypotheses. Generated hypotheses linked organic phosphate utilization to Gammaproteobactaria, Plantcomycetes, and Betaproteobacteria, chitin degradation to Actinomycetes, and potential small molecule biosynthesis pathways for Lentisphaerae, Chlamydiae, and Crenarchaeota. The PRMT method can be applied as a general tool for the analysis of additional metagenomic or transcriptomic datasets.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Here we describe, the longest microbial time-series analyzed to date using high-resolution 16S rRNA tag pyrosequencing of samples taken monthly over 6 years at a temperate marine coastal site off Plymouth, UK. Data treatment effected the estimation of community richness over a 6-year period, whereby 8794 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified using single-linkage preclustering and 21 130 OTUs were identified by denoising the data. The Alphaproteobacteria were the most abundant Class, and the most frequently recorded OTUs were members of the Rickettsiales (SAR 11) and Rhodobacteriales. This near-surface ocean bacterial community showed strong repeatable seasonal patterns, which were defined by winter peaks in diversity across all years. Environmental variables explained far more variation in seasonally predictable bacteria than did data on protists or metazoan biomass. Change in day length alone explains &gt;65% of the variance in community diversity. The results suggested that seasonal changes in environmental variables are more important than trophic interactions. Interestingly, microbial association network analysis showed that correlations in abundance were stronger within bacterial taxa rather than between bacteria and eukaryotes, or between bacteria and environmental variables.

publication_nr_2_pubmed_abstract	Both metagenomic data and metatranscriptomic data were collected from surface water (0-2m) of the L4 sampling station (50.2518 N, 4.2089 W), which is part of the Western Channel Observatory long-term coastal-marine monitoring station. We previously generated from this area a six-year time series of 16S rRNA V6 data, which demonstrated robust seasonal structure for the bacterial community, with diversity correlated with day length. Here we describe the features of these metagenomes and metatranscriptomes. We generated 8 metagenomes (4.5 million sequences, 1.9 Gbp, average read-length 350 bp) and 7 metatranscriptomes (392,632 putative mRNA-derived sequences, 159 Mbp, average read-length 272 bp) for eight time-points sampled in 2008. These time points represent three seasons (winter, spring, and summer) and include both day and night samples. These data demonstrate the major differences between genetic potential and actuality, whereby genomes follow general seasonal trends yet with surprisingly little change in the functional potential over time; transcripts tended to be far more structured by changes occurring between day and night.
