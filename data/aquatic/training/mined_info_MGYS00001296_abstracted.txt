study_name	Metagenomic recovery of phage assemblage from Manikaran hot springs
study_abstract	Phages are the most dominant predators of prokaryotic community at thermal springs characterized by restricted eukaryotic grazing pressures yet understanding of the phage ecology remains limited at hydrothermal environments. This study examines the metagenomic profiles of phages across Himalayan hot springs (1760 m) at Manikaran by employing the environmental data from sediment (n = 4, 78Â°C-98Â°C) and microbial mat (n = 2, 57Â°C) deposited around thermal discharges that led to de novo reconstruction of 65 phages (24-200 Kbp). 91% (60/65) of the phages belonged to the order Caudovirales including members from Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, Podoviridae and Inoviridae with distinguishing enrichment of Siphoviridae and Myoviridae across sediment and microbial mats, respectively highlighting the temperature driven shaping of phage community. Whole genome based analysis of the phages demonstrated well-conserved phages across sediments in contrast to the microbial mat owing to moderately mesophilic microbial mats (57Â°C) compared to the thermophillic sediments (78Â°C-98Â°C). A minimal phage genome (28 orthologous proteins) was maintained across both sediment and microbial mats including proteins like histidine kinase, integrase, and Clp protease suggesting a common origin over an inter-habitat distance of 500 m. In an attempt to reconstruct potential hosts for phages from the metagenome data, genomes for Ralstonia (5 Mbp), Pseudoxanthomonas (3.5 Mbp), Dechloromonas (1.9 Mbp), Herbaspirillum (1.5 Mbp) were assembled with integrated phages and unique CRISPR arrays suggesting prior phage infections and rapidly acquired immunity against future phage attacks at these hot springs. This study provides detailed insights into the genetic give-and-take between hosts and their phages in specific ecological niches of Manikaran thermal springs.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Hot spring-associated viruses, particularly the archaeal viruses, remain under-examined compared to bacteriophages. Previous metagenomic studies of the Manikaran hot springs in India suggested an abundance of viral DNA, which prompted us to examine the virus-host (bacterial and archaeal) interactions in sediment and microbial mat samples collected from the thermal discharges. Here, we characterize the viruses (both bacterial and archaeal) from this Himalayan hot spring using both metagenomics assembly and electron microscopy. We utilized four shotgun samples from sediment (78-98C) and two from microbial mats (50C) to reconstruct 65 bacteriophage genomes (24-200 kb). We also identified 59 archaeal viruses that were notably abundant across the sediment samples. Whole-genome analyses of the reconstructed bacteriophage genomes revealed greater genomic conservation in sediments (65%) compared to microbial mats (49%). However, a minimal phage genome was still maintained across both sediment and microbial mats suggesting a common origin. To complement the metagenomic data, scanning-electron and helium-ion microscopy were used to reveal diverse morphotypes of Caudovirales and archaeal viruses. The genome level annotations provide further evidence for gene-level exchange between virus and host in these hot springs, and augments our knowledgebase for bacteriophages, archaeal viruses and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat cassettes, which provide a critical resource for studying viromes in extreme natural environments.
