study_name	Bacterial composition and survival on Sahara dust particles transported to the European Alps
study_abstract	The Sahara Desert is the primary source of wind-blown biological and mineral particles (aerosols) on Earth, 10% of which arrive to Europe. Aerosols that are deposited on high alpine snowfields in freezing conditions are well preserved and facilitate downstream biological analyses. As little is known about the structure and viability of bacteria transported during Saharan dust events (SDEs), the goal of this study was to characterize SDE-associated bacteria in snow using an interdisciplinary approach. We collected samples from a snow profile at the Jungfraujoch (Swiss Alps; 3621 m asl), where the presence of distinct ochre Sahara dust layers (SD-layers) could be ascribed to two SDEs reported in February and May 2014. Backward trajectories, physicochemical analyses of the snow, and dust particle concentrations of distinct geochemical compositions permitted us to determine the origin of the SDEs. Bacterial community structures were assessed using high throughput sequencing; distinct differences in bacterial community structures and metabolic activity associated with SD-layers as compared to clean snow layers were observed. Most striking was the exclusive presence in the SD-layers of bacteria that are adapted to hostile environments, and are hence well suited to survive the harsh conditions of long-distance airborne transport.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Deposition of Sahara dust (SD) particles is a frequent phenomenon in Europe, but little is known about the viability and composition of the bacterial community transported with SD. The goal of this study was to characterize SD-associated bacteria transported to the European Alps, deposited and entrapped in snow. During two distinct events in February and May 2014, SD particles were deposited and promptly covered by falling snow, thus preserving them in distinct ochre layers within the snowpack. In June 2014, we collected samples at different depths from a snow profile at the Jungfraujoch (Swiss Alps; 3621 m a.s.l.). After filtration, we performed various microbiological and physicochemical analyses of the snow and dust particles therein that originated in Algeria. Our results show that bacteria survive and are metabolically active after the transport to the European Alps. Using high throughput sequencing, we observed distinct differences in bacterial community composition and structure in SD-layers as compared to clean snow layers. Sporulating bacteria were not enriched in the SD-layers; however, phyla with low abundance such as Gemmatimonadetes and Deinococcus-Thermus appeared to be specific bio-indicators for SD. Since many members of these phyla are known to be adapted to arid oligotrophic environments and UV radiation, they are well suited to survive the harsh conditions of long-range airborne transport.
