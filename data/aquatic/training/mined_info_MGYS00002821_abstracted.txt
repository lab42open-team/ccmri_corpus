study_name	Microbial diversity associated with copepods in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre
study_abstract	To characterize microscale spatial heterogeneity, microbial community composition of microzooplankton, primarily small copepods, was investigated in comparison to bacterioplankton in surrounding seawater from the oligotrophic open ocean. Zooplankton individuals were collected at or above the deep chlorophyll maximum in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, and the diversity of microbial communities was investigated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing targeting the V5-V9 region. Zooplankton studied included the copepods Undinula vulgaris, Pleuromamma spp., Sapphirina metalina, Pseudocalanus spp., and Tigriopus sp., and an amphipod, Phrosina semilunata. High -diversity was observed among samples, with zooplankton taxa-specific bacterial communities distinct from the communities in the surrounding seawater. The taxonomic composition of the microbial communities suggests both external and internal associations are present. Copepod association is a unique microbial niche that may play a role in biogeochemical cycling in the oligotrophic open ocean.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Copepods are the dominant members of the zooplankton community and the most abundant form of life. It is imperative to obtain insights into the copepod-associated bacteriobiomes (CAB) in order to identify specific bacterial taxa associated within a copepod, and to understand how they vary between different copepods. Analysing the potential genes within the CAB may reveal their intrinsic role in biogeochemical cycles. For this, machine-learning models and PICRUSt2 analysis were deployed to analyse 16S rDNA gene sequences (approximately 16 million reads) of CAB belonging to five different copepod genera viz., Acartia spp., Calanus spp., Centropages sp., Pleuromamma spp., and Temora spp.. Overall, we predict 50 sub-OTUs (s-OTUs) (gradient boosting classifiers) to be important in five copepod genera. Among these, 15 s-OTUs were predicted to be important in Calanus spp. and 20 s-OTUs as important in Pleuromamma spp.. Four bacterial s-OTUs Acinetobacter johnsonii, Phaeobacter, Vibrio shilonii and Piscirickettsiaceae were identified as important s-OTUs in Calanus spp., and the s-OTUs Marinobacter, Alteromonas, Desulfovibrio, Limnobacter, Sphingomonas, Methyloversatilis, Enhydrobacter and Coriobacteriaceae were predicted as important s-OTUs in Pleuromamma spp., for the first time. Our meta-analysis revealed that the CAB of Pleuromamma spp. had a high proportion of potential genes responsible for methanogenesis and nitrogen fixation, whereas the CAB of Temora spp. had a high proportion of potential genes involved in assimilatory sulphate reduction, and cyanocobalamin synthesis. The CAB of Pleuromamma spp. and Temora spp. have potential genes accountable for iron transport.
