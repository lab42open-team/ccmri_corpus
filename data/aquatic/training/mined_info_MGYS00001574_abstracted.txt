study_name	Using Illumina MiSeq platform to sequence the partial 16S rRNA library of the hot spring sample
study_abstract	A comprehensive investigation of the microbial community composition and taxonomy of Sungai Klah, which is located in Perak, Malaysia. It is the second hottest geothermal springs in Malaysia. The hot spring is a streamer-like and several spring heads with boiling temperature (100-110 ?C) are presence. Other parts of the streaming water exhibit the temperature ranging from 50?100 ?C. Little knowledge on the types of hyper- and thermophilic within this hot spring is known. Furthermore, this high temperature environment condition serves as a source for understanding the genetic diversity, population structure, and ecological roles of these boiling point-tolerant microorganisms.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	This report describes the biodiversity and ecology of microbial mats developed in thermal gradients (20 to 65C) in the surroundings of three drillings (Chiraleu [CH], Ciocaia [CI], and Mihai Bravu [MB]) tapping a hyperthermal aquifer in Romania. Using a metabarcoding approach, 16S rRNA genes were sequenced from both DNA and RNA transcripts (cDNA) and compared. The relationships between the microbial diversity and the physicochemical factors were explored. Additionally, the cDNA data were used for <i>in silico</i> functionality predictions, bringing new insights into the functional potential and dynamics of these communities. The results showed that each hot spring determined the formation of distinct microbial communities. In the CH mats (40 to 53C), the abundance of <i>Cyanobacteria</i> decreased with temperature, opposite to those of <i>Chloroflexi</i> and <i>Proteobacteria</i><i>Ectothiorhodospira</i>, <i>Oscillatoria</i>, and methanogenic archaea dominated the CI communities (20 to 65C), while the MB microbial mats (53 to 65C) were mainly composed of <i>Chloroflexi</i>, <i>Hydrogenophilus</i>, <i>Thermi</i>, and <i>Aquificae</i> Alpha-diversity was negatively correlated with the increase in water temperature, while beta-diversity was shaped in each hot spring by the unique combination of physicochemical parameters, regardless of the type of nucleic acid analyzed (DNA versus cDNA). The rank correlation analysis revealed a unique model that associated environmental data with community composition, consisting in the combined effect of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> concentrations, together with temperature and electrical conductivity. These factors seem to determine the grouping of samples according to location, rather than with the similarities in thermal regimes, showing that other parameters beside temperature are significant drivers of biodiversity.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Hot spring microbial mats represent a remarkable manifestation of life on Earth and have been intensively studied for decades. Moreover, as hot spring areas are isolated and have a limited exchange of organisms, nutrients, and energy with the surrounding environments, hot spring microbial communities can be used in model studies to elucidate the colonizing potential within extreme settings. Thus, they are of great importance in evolutionary biology, microbial ecology, and exobiology. In spite of all the efforts that have been made, the current understanding of the influence of temperature and water chemistry on the microbial community composition, diversity, and abundance in microbial mats is limited. In this study, the composition and diversity of microbial communities developed in thermal gradients in the vicinity of three hot springs from Romania were investigated, each having particular physicochemical characteristics. Our results expose new factors that could determine the formation of these ecosystems, expanding the current knowledge in this regard.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Malaysia has a great number of hot springs, especially along the flank of the Banjaran Titiwangsa mountain range. Biological studies of the Malaysian hot springs are rare because of the lack of comprehensive information on their microbial communities. In this study, we report a cultivation-independent census to describe microbial communities in six hot springs. The Ulu Slim (US), Sungai Klah (SK), Dusun Tua (DT), Sungai Serai (SS), Semenyih (SE), and Ayer Hangat (AH) hot springs exhibit circumneutral pH with temperatures ranging from 43C to 90C. Genomic DNA was extracted from environmental samples and the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. High-throughput sequencing analysis showed that microbial richness was high in all samples as indicated by the detection of 6,334-26,244 operational taxonomy units. In total, 59, 61, 72, 73, 65, and 52 bacterial phyla were identified in the US, SK, DT, SS, SE, and AH hot springs, respectively. Generally, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominated the bacterial communities in all hot springs. Archaeal communities mainly consisted of Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, and Parvarchaeota. In beta diversity analysis, the hot spring microbial memberships were clustered primarily on the basis of temperature and salinity. Canonical correlation analysis to assess the relationship between the microbial communities and physicochemical variables revealed that diversity patterns were best explained by a combination of physicochemical variables, rather than by individual abiotic variables such as temperature and salinity.

publication_nr_2_pubmed_abstract	The Sungai Klah (SK) hot spring is the second hottest geothermal spring in Malaysia. This hot spring is a shallow, 150-m-long, fast-flowing stream, with temperatures varying from 50 to 110C and a pH range of 7.0-9.0. Hidden within a wooded area, the SK hot spring is continually fed by plant litter, resulting in a relatively high degree of total organic content (TOC). In this study, a sample taken from the middle of the stream was analyzed at the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region by amplicon metagenome sequencing. Over 35 phyla were detected by analyzing the 16S rRNA data. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria represented approximately 57% of the microbiome. Approximately 70% of the detected thermophiles were strict anaerobes; however, Hydrogenobacter spp., obligate chemolithotrophic thermophiles, represented one of the major taxa. Several thermophilic photosynthetic microorganisms and acidothermophiles were also detected. Most of the phyla identified by 16S rRNA were also found using the shotgun metagenome approaches. The carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen metabolism within the SK hot spring community were evaluated by shotgun metagenome sequencing, and the data revealed diversity in terms of metabolic activity and dynamics. This hot spring has a rich diversified phylogenetic community partly due to its natural environment (plant litter, high TOC, and a shallow stream) and geochemical parameters (broad temperature and pH range). It is speculated that symbiotic relationships occur between the members of the community.
