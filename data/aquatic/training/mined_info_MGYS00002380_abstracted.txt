publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Prokaryoplankton genomes from the deep marine sediments are less explored compared to shallow shore sediments. The Gulfs of Kathiawar peninsula experience varied currents and inputs from different on-shore activities. Any perturbations would directly influence the microbiome and their normal homeostasis. Advancements in reconstructing genomes from metagenomes allows us to understand the role of individual unculturable microbes in ecological niches like the Gulf sediments. Here, we report 309 bacterial and archaeal genomes assembled from metagenomics data of deep sediments from sites in the Gulf of Khambhat and Gulf of Kutch as well as a sample from the Arabian Sea. Phylogenomics classified them into 5 archaeal and 18 bacterial phyla. The genomes will facilitate understanding of the physiology, adaptation and impact of on-shore anthropogenic activities on the deep sediment microbes.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Antibiotics have been widely spread in the environments, imposing profound stress on the resistome of the residing microbes. Marine microbiomes are well established large reservoirs of novel antibiotics and corresponding resistance genes. The Gulf of Khambhat is known for its extreme tides and complex sedimentation process. We performed high throughput sequencing and applied bioinformatics techniques on pelagic sediment microbiome across four coordinates of the Gulf of Khambhat to assess the marine resistome, its corresponding bacterial community and compared with the open Arabian Sea sample. We identified a total of 2354 unique types of resistance genes, with most abundant and diverse gene profile in the area that had anthropogenic activities being carried out on-shore. The genes with &gt;1% abundance in all samples included carA, macB, sav1866, tlrC, srmB, taeA, tetA, oleC and bcrA which belonged to the macrolides, glycopeptides and peptide drug classes. ARG enriched phyla distribution was quite varying between all the sites, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes among the dominant phyla. Based on the outcomes, we also propose potential biomarker candidates Desulfovibrio, Thermotaga and Pelobacter for antibiotic monitoring in the two of the Gulf samples probable contamination prone environments, and genera Nitrosocccus, Marinobacter and Streptomyces in the rest of the three studied samples. Outcomes support the concept that ARGs naturally originate in environments and human activities contribute to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
