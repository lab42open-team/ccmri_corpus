study_name	Linking DNRA community structure and activity in a shallow lagoonal estuarine system
study_abstract	Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and denitrification are two nitrate respiration pathways in the microbial nitrogen cycle. Diversity and abundance of denitrifying bacteria have been extensively examined in various ecosystems. However, studies on DNRA bacterial diversity are limited, and the linkage between structure and activity of DNRA communities has yet to be discovered. We examined the composition, abundance and activities of DNRA communities at five sites along salinity gradients in the New River Estuary, North Carolina, USA, a shallow eutrophic system. Sediment slurry incubation experiments with 15N-nitrate were conducted to measure potential DNRA rates while abundance of DNRA communities was estimated using quantitative PCR of nrfA genes encoding cytochrome C nitrite reductase, which is unique to DNRA. A pyrosequencing method targeting nrfA genes was developed using an Ion Torrent sequencer to examine diversity and composition of DNRA communities within the estuarine sediment communities. We found a positive correlation between nrfA gene abundance and DNRA rates. Among the environmental variables, %organic and sulfide in sediments might support higher activities of DNRA communities. Pyrosequencing analysis of nrfA genes revealed spatial variation of DNRA communities along the saline gradient of New River Estuary. Relative abundance of dominant populations was found to have significant influences on overall activities and abundance of DNRA communities. Thus, we found that abundance of dominant DNRA bacteria was an important regulator of DNRA activities in the eutrophic New River Estuary.

We examined the composition, diversity, abundance, and activities of DNRA communities at five sites along a salinity gradient in the New River Estuary, North Carolina, USA, a shallow temporal/lagoonal estuarine system. Sediment slurry incubation experiments with (15)N-nitrate were conducted to measure potential DNRA rates, while the abundance of DNRA communities was calculated using quantitative PCR of nrfA genes encoding cytochrome C nitrite reductase, commonly found in DNRA bacteria. A pyrosequencing method targeting nrfA genes was developed using an Ion Torrent sequencer to examine the diversity and composition of DNRA communities within the estuarine sediment community. We found higher levels of nrfA gene abundance and DNRA activities in sediments with higher percent organic content. Pyrosequencing analysis of nrfA genes revealed spatial variation of DNRA communities along the salinity gradient of the New River Estuary. Percent abundance of dominant populations was found to have significant influence on overall activities of DNRA communities. Abundance of dominant DNRA bacteria and organic carbon availability are important regulators of DNRA activities in the eutrophic New River Estuary.
