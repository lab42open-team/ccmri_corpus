study_abstract	We applied culture-independent, high throughput pyrosequencing to characterize the microbial communities associated with coastal seawater adjacent to populated Broward County, FL. These waters flow over adjacent coral reefs, which help compose the Florida reef tract, and also close to recreational beaches. In partnership with the NOAA FACE program to survey water quality, 38 total nearshore seawater samples were collected and characterized for bacterial populations from 6 distinct coastal locales - the Port Everglades and Hillsboro Inlets, Hollywood and Broward wastewater outfalls, and associated reef waters over the course of one year. More than 227,000 quality checked 16S rRNA V4 amplicon sequences were generated for longitudinal taxonomic profiles of marine bacteria and archaea. From these sequences, 4447 unique OTUs were found and there was a mean OTU count of 5986.816 across all site. Sequences were found to vary significantly due to seasonal effects and by site, but depth showed no significant correlation. Abundant microbial taxa across all samples included Synechococcus, Pelagibacteraceae, Bacteroidetes, and various Proteobacteria. Inlet-based communities significantly differed from outfall and reef communities, with a relative increase in Rhodobacteraceae and Cryomorphaceae, and depletion of SAR406 sequences. Unifrac analysis confirmed significant differences in the inlet populations relative to reef and outfall microbial communities. However, based on alpha diversity measurements, the outfalls sites showed the most diversity with the occurrence of Thiotrichales, Alteromonadales, and the archaean Thermoplasmata. This study also found increased levels of Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and sludge associated bacterial OTUs such as SBR1093 at the outfall and reef sites.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Coastal waters adjacent to populated southeast Florida possess different habitats (reefs, oceanic inlets, sewage outfalls) that may affect the composition of their inherent microbiomes. To determine variation according to site, season, and depth, over the course of 1 year, we characterized the bacterioplankton communities within 38 nearshore seawater samples derived from the Florida Area Coastal Environment (FACE) water quality survey. Six distinct coastal locales were profiled - the Port Everglades and Hillsboro Inlets, Hollywood and Broward wastewater outfalls, and associated reef sites using culture-independent, high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region. More than 227,000 sequences helped describe longitudinal taxonomic profiles of marine bacteria and archaea. There were 4447 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified with a mean OTU count of 5986 OTUs across all sites. Bacterial taxa varied significantly by season and by site using weighted and unweighted Unifrac, but depth was only supported by weighted Unifrac, suggesting a change due to presence/absence of certain OTUs. Abundant microbial taxa across all samples included Synechococcus, Pelagibacteraceae, Bacteroidetes, and various Proteobacteria. Unifrac analysis confirmed significant differences at inlet sites relative to reef and outfalls. Inlet-based bacterioplankton significantly differed in greater abundances of Rhodobacteraceae and Cryomorphaceae, and depletion of SAR406 sequences. This study also found higher counts of Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and wastewater associated SBR1093 bacteria at the outfall and reef sites compared to inlet sites. This study profiles local bacterioplankton populations in a much broader context, beyond culturing and quantitative PCR, and expands upon the work completed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration FACE program.
