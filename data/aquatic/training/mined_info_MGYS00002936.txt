study_name	16S rRNA sequences of bacterioplankton spatial distributions in the Baltic Proper
study_abstract	The overall goal of this spatial sampling of marine bacterioplankton was to observe the distribution of populations from coastal to offshore. In relation to bacterial production and primary production such information is relevant for investigating coastal to offshore food web efficiency and the role of bacterioplankton community composition in food web dynamics.
