study_abstract	The Roseobacter group within the family Rhodobacteraceae consists of nearly 70 genera and app. 180 species. They thrive in a broad variety of marine habitats and were found free-living in seawater, associated with micro and macro algae, marine sponges and invertebrates as well as in biofilms, sea ice and sediments. n the present study, we describe the abundance, distribution and diversity of the Roseobacter group in rather oligotrophic deep-sea sediments derived from the Pacific Ocean as all other benthic studies were performed on relatively eutrophic coastal sites or high-energy systems.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	By now, only limited information on the <i>Roseobacter</i> group thriving at the seafloor is available. Hence, the current study was conducted to determine their abundance and diversity within Pacific sediments along the 180 meridian. We hypothesize a distinct biogeographical distribution of benthic members of the <i>Roseobacter</i> group linked to nutrient availability within the sediments and productivity of the water column. Lowest cell numbers were counted at the edge of the south Pacific gyre and within the north Pacific gyre followed by an increase to the north with maximum values in the highly productive Bering Sea. Specific quantification of the <i>Roseobacter</i> group revealed on average a relative abundance of 1.7 and 6.3% as determined by catalyzed reported deposition-fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (CARD-FISH) and quantitative PCR (qPCR), respectively. Corresponding Illumina tag sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and 16S rRNA transcripts showed different compositions containing on average 0.7 and 0.9% <i>Roseobacter</i>-affiliated OTUs of the DNA- and RNA-based communities. These OTUs were mainly assigned to uncultured members of the <i>Roseobacter</i> group. Among those with cultured representatives, <i>Sedimentitalea</i> and <i>Sulfitobacter</i> made up the largest proportions. The different oceanic provinces with low nutrient content such as both ocean gyres were characterized by specific communities of the <i>Roseobacter</i> group, distinct from those of the more productive Pacific subarctic region and the Bering Sea. However, linking the community structure to specific metabolic processes at the seafloor is hampered by the dominance of so-far uncultured members of the <i>Roseobacter</i> group, indicating a diversity that has yet to be explored.
