study_name	construction of minimal coastal microbial mats
study_abstract	Minimal coastal microbial mats were created with diluted coastal mat samples obtained from the Dutch barrier island of Schiermonnikoog. The MM"s were inoculated in fresh sterilized sand in glass containers contained in a MicroBox. The MicroBox has a transparent lid (allowing photosynthetic growth) and a gas exchange filter. The MM"s are propagated under laboratory conditions at a 16h light / 8h dark regime and at a constant 23 C. Serial dilutions used for this data-set are 0, 3 and 5-fold.
