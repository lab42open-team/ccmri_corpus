study_abstract	A total of 52,928 pyrosequencing reads were analyzed in order to reveal the bacterial community structures in stream and lake surface water samples from Fuglebekken and Revvatnet basins of the southern Svalbard. Depending on the sample examined, bacterial communities at higher taxonomic level consisted mainly either of Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria and Microgenomates (OP11), or of Planctomycetes, Betaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes members, whereas in two of them, a notable Microgenomates population was identified. At the lower taxonomic level, bacterial communities comprised mostly of Microgenomates, Comamonadaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Legionellales, SM2F11, Parcubacteria (OD1) and TM7 members, although at different proportions in each sample. The abundance of OTUs shared in common among samples exceeded 70%, with the exception of samples in which the proliferation of Planctomycetaceae, Phycisphaeraceae and Candidatus Methylacidiphilum spp. lowered their relative abundance. Multi-variable analysis indicated that As, Pb and Sb were the main environmental factors influencing bacterial profiles.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Two thirds of Svalbard archipelago islands in the High Arctic are permanently covered with glacial ice and snow. Polar bacterial communities in the southern part of Svalbard were characterized using an amplicon sequencing approach. A total of 52,928 pyrosequencing reads were analyzed in order to reveal bacterial community structures in stream and lake surface water samples from the Fuglebekken and Revvatnet basins of southern Svalbard. Depending on the samples examined, bacterial communities at a higher taxonomic level mainly consisted either of Bacteroidetes, Betaproteobacteria, and Microgenomates (OP11) or Planctomycetes, Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes members, whereas a population of Microgenomates was prominent in 2 samples. At the lower taxonomic level, bacterial communities mostly comprised Microgenomates, Comamonadaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, Legionellales, SM2F11, Parcubacteria (OD1), and TM7 members at different proportions in each sample. The abundance of OTUs shared in common among samples was greater than 70%, with the exception of samples in which the proliferation of Planctomycetaceae, Phycisphaeraceae, and Candidatus Methylacidiphilum spp. lowered their relative abundance. A multi-variable analysis indicated that As, Pb, and Sb were the main environmental factors influencing bacterial profiles. We concluded that the bacterial communities in the polar aquatic ecosystems examined mainly consisted of freshwater and marine microorganisms involved in detritus mineralization, with a high proportion of zooplankton-associated taxa also being identified.
