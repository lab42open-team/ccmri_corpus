study_name	SSU rRNA amplicon of the Arctic Ocean during Winter-Spring Transition
study_abstract	One of the main concerns about the Arctic Ocean has been the changing sea ice regime with a reduction in the summer sea ice extent and a shift in dominance from thicker, perennial multiyear ice towards thinner, first-year ice. As the dietary basis of marine food webs and central players of biogeochemical cycles, microbial communities play an irreplaceable role when evaluating the ecological impact of the Arctics thinner ice regime. During the Norwegian young sea Ice cruise 2015 (N-ICE2015), that took place in drifting pack ice north of Svalbard between January-June 2015, seawater was collected, at 5, 20 or 50, 250 m depth in 9th March, 27th April and 16th June, together with physical and biogeochemical data. Through the massively parallel sequencing of SSU rRNA amplicon we expect to get a snapshot of the Arctics microbiota diversity and structure through the dark-light transition.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	One of the most prominent manifestations of climate change is the changing Arctic sea-ice regime with a reduction in the summer sea-ice extent and a shift from thicker, perennial multiyear ice towards thinner, first-year ice. These changes in the physical environment are likely to impact microbial communities, a key component of Arctic marine food webs and biogeochemical cycles. During the Norwegian young sea ICE expedition (N-ICE2015) north of Svalbard, seawater samples were collected at the surface (5 m), subsurface (20 or 50 m), and mesopelagic (250 m) depths on 9 March, 27 April, and 16 June 2015. In addition, several physical and biogeochemical data were recorded to contextualize the collected microbial communities. Through the massively parallel sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal RNA amplicon and metagenomic data, this work allows studying the Arctic's microbial community structure during the late winter to early summer transition. Results showed that, at compositional level, Alpha- (30.7%) and Gammaproteobacteria (28.6%) are the most frequent taxa across the prokaryotic N-ICE2015 collection, and also the most phylogenetically diverse. Winter to early summer trends were quite evident since there was a high relative abundance of thaumarchaeotes in the under-ice water column in late winter while this group was nearly absent during early summer. Moreover, the emergence of Flavobacteria and the SAR92 clade in early summer might be associated with the degradation of a spring bloom of Phaeocystis. High relative abundance of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, particularly Alcanivorax (54.3%) and Marinobacter (6.3%), was also found. Richness showed different patterns along the depth gradient for prokaryotic (highest at mesopelagic depth) and protistan communities (higher at subsurface depths). The microbial N-ICE2015 collection analyzed in the present study provides comprehensive new knowledge about the pelagic microbiota below drifting Arctic sea-ice. The higher microbial diversity found in late winter/early spring communities reinforces the need to continue with further studies to properly characterize the winter microbial communities under the pack-ice.
