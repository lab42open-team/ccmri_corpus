study_name	Vertical organization of freshwater sediment microbial communities: implications for microbial activities and burial processes
study_abstract	Microbial activity in lake sediments plays a key role in the cycling of nutrients and organic matter that continuously sink from water columns. As organic matter accumulates at the sediment surface, upper sediment layers become buried, resulting in a decrease in microbial activity and cell turnover rate with increasing depth. To better understand the structure of freshwater sediment communities and how the burial processes influence it, we quantified the distribution of a broad range of environmental parameters and the community structure of microbial archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes in the sediments of a clear, temperate lake. Our findings suggest that the two uppermost horizons of the sediment community, which cover approximately the last 70 years, are characterized by a high taxa replacement influenced by “present” environmental parameters. Richness effects became increasingly important in the lowest studied horizon (14-30 cm, age 70-150 a) and could be readily explained by conservative “past” environmental parameters. The lowest horizon is also characterized by a switch in dominance toward archaea, as has been found in marine sediments. Our pioneering study shows that the freshwater lake's community structure, taxa, and vertical arrangement share many features previously observed for marine sediments.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Lake sediments harbor diverse microbial communities that cycle carbon and nutrients while being constantly colonized and potentially buried by organic matter sinking from the water column. The interaction of activity and burial remained largely unexplored in aquatic sediments. We aimed to relate taxonomic composition to sediment biogeochemical parameters, test whether community turnover with depth resulted from taxonomic replacement or from richness effects, and to provide a basic model for the vertical community structure in sediments. We analyzed four replicate sediment cores taken from 30-m depth in oligo-mesotrophic Lake Stechlin in northern Germany. Each 30-cm core spanned ca. 170 years of sediment accumulation according to <sup>137</sup>Cs dating and was sectioned into layers 1-4 cm thick. We examined a full suite of biogeochemical parameters and used DNA metabarcoding to examine community composition of microbial Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota. Community Beta-diversity indicated nearly complete turnover within the uppermost 30 cm. We observed a pronounced shift from Eukaryota- and Bacteria-dominated upper layers (&lt;5 cm) to Bacteria-dominated intermediate layers (5-14 cm) and to deep layers (&gt;14 cm) dominated by enigmatic Archaea that typically occur in deep-sea sediments. Taxonomic replacement was the prevalent mechanism in structuring the community composition and was linked to parameters indicative of microbial activity (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> concentration, bacterial protein production). Richness loss played a lesser role but was linked to conservative parameters (e.g., C, N, P) indicative of past conditions. By including all three domains, we were able to directly link the exponential decay of eukaryotes with the active sediment microbial community. The dominance of Archaea in deeper layers confirms earlier findings from marine systems and establishes freshwater sediments as a potential low-energy environment, similar to deep sea sediments. We propose a general model of sediment structure and function based on microbial characteristics and burial processes. An upper "replacement horizon" is dominated by rapid taxonomic turnover with depth, high microbial activity, and biotic interactions. A lower "depauperate horizon" is characterized by low taxonomic richness, more stable "low-energy" conditions, and a dominance of enigmatic Archaea.
