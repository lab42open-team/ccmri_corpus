study_abstract	Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are oxygen deficient regions of the ocean that are hotspots for nutrient and climate active trace gas cycling. Forming at intermediate depths (~1001000 m) in response to high biological oxygen demand and reduced ventilation, OMZs occur naturally in regions of high productivity and nutrient-rich upwelling. Global climate change and enhanced run-off from our farms and cities also contributes to OMZ formation and expansion. An expansive and permanent OMZ persists in the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) along the coast of northern Chile and Peru. Studies in the ETSP-OMZ have been critical in charting the microbial communities and metabolic processes driving coupled biogeochemical cycling in coastal and open ocean OMZs throughout the global ocean.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	A major percentage of fixed nitrogen (N) loss in the oceans occurs within nitrite-rich oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) via denitrification and anammox. It remains unclear to what extent ammonium and nitrite oxidation co-occur, either supplying or competing for substrates involved in nitrogen loss in the OMZ core. Assessment of the oxygen (O2) sensitivity of these processes down to the O2 concentrations present in the OMZ core (&lt;10 nmol.L(-1)) is therefore essential for understanding and modeling nitrogen loss in OMZs. We determined rates of ammonium and nitrite oxidation in the seasonal OMZ off Concepcion, Chile at manipulated O2 levels between 5 nmol.L(-1) and 20 mymol.L(-1) Rates of both processes were detectable in the low nanomolar range (5-33 nmol.L(-1) O2), but demonstrated a strong dependence on O2 concentrations with apparent half-saturation constants (Kms) of 333 +/- 130 nmol.L(-1) O2 for ammonium oxidation and 778 +/- 168 nmol.L(-1) O2 for nitrite oxidation assuming one-component Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Nitrite oxidation rates, however, were better described with a two-component Michaelis-Menten model, indicating a high-affinity component with a Km of just a few nanomolar. As the communities of ammonium and nitrite oxidizers were similar to other OMZs, these kinetics should apply across OMZ systems. The high O2 affinities imply that ammonium and nitrite oxidation can occur within the OMZ core whenever O2 is supplied, for example, by episodic intrusions. These processes therefore compete with anammox and denitrification for ammonium and nitrite, thereby exerting an important control over nitrogen loss.
