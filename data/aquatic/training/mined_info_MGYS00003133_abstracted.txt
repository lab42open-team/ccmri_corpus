study_abstract	Coastal marine environments have been impacted by human activity for several centuries, including shoreline alteration, nutrient introduction, sedimentation, toxic compound release, and thermal modification. Mt. Hope Bay, Massachusetts is an ideal site to base a study of human pathogen presence and distribution because it has several important sources of human impact, including sewage disposal sites and the thermal outfall of a power plant within a mile of each other. The Bay has undergone limited monitoring for several different parameters, including fish populations, river runoff, meteorological forcing, tidal cycles and water chemistry as part of the Mt. Hope Bay Natural Laboratory (MHBNL) program, a 5-year interdisciplinary project at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School of Marine Science and Technology (SMAST). While phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in the water column have been fairly well monitored, although not at a molecular level, microbial communities remain relatively uncharacterized. This project presents comprehensive (eukaryal, bacterial, archaeal) data from small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene clone libraries and next-generation Illumina amplicon sequencing for samples collected near the thermal plume and underlying sediments of the Brayton Point Power Plant. Not surprising, our findings reveal a highly diverse consortium of the three domains including relatives of sludge bacteria, polyaromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, and representatives related to the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium. It is clear that even limited knowledge about the overall microbial community composition can lead to important observations about the ecosystem as a whole. Furthermore, understanding whether free-living pathogens participate in relationships with other members of the microbial community will be important in understanding their distributions and persistence.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The genus Vibrio is a metabolically diverse group of facultative anaerobic bacteria, common in aquatic environments and marine hosts. The genus contains several species of importance to human health and aquaculture, including the causative agents of human cholera and fish vibriosis. Vibrios display a wide variety of known life histories, from opportunistic pathogens to long-standing symbionts with individual host species. Studying Vibrio ecology has been challenging as individual species often display a wide range of habitat preferences, and groups of vibrios can act as socially cohesive groups. Although strong associations with salinity, temperature and other environmental variables have been established, the degree of habitat or host specificity at both the individual and community levels is unknown. Here we use oligotyping analyses in combination with a large collection of existing Vibrio 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence data to reveal patterns of Vibrio ecology across a wide range of environmental, host, and abiotic substrate associated habitats. Our data show that individual taxa often display a wide range of habitat preferences yet tend to be highly abundant in either substrate-associated or free-living environments. Our analyses show that Vibrio communities share considerable overlap between two distinct hosts (i.e., sponge and fish), yet are distinct from the abiotic plastic substrates. Lastly, evidence for habitat specificity at the community level exists in some habitats, despite considerable stochasticity in others. In addition to providing insights into Vibrio ecology across a broad range of habitats, our study shows the utility of oligotyping as a facile, high-throughput and unbiased method for large-scale analyses of publically available sequence data repositories and suggests its wide application could greatly extend the range of possibilities to explore microbial ecology.
