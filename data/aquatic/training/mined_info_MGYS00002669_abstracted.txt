publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	<i>Vibrio</i> spp. have been a persistent concern for coastal bivalve hatcheries, which are vulnerable to environmental pathogens in the seawater used for rearing larvae, yet the biogeochemical drivers of oyster-pathogenic <i>Vibrio</i> spp. in their planktonic state are poorly understood. Here, we present data tracking oyster-pathogenic <i>Vibrio</i> bacteria in Netarts Bay and Yaquina Bay in Oregon, USA, as well as in adjacent coastal waters and a local shellfish hatchery, through the 2015 upwelling season. <i>Vibrio</i> populations were quantified using a culture-independent approach of high-throughput <i>Vibrio-</i>specific 16S rRNA gene sequencing paired with droplet digital PCR, and abundances were analyzed in the context of local biogeochemistry. The most abundant putative pathogen in our samples was <i>Vibrio coralliilyticus</i> Environmental concentrations of total <i>Vibrio</i> spp. and <i>V. coralliilyticus</i> were highest in Netarts Bay sediment samples and higher in seawater from Netarts Bay than from nearshore coastal waters or Yaquina Bay. In Netarts Bay, the highest <i>V. coralliilyticus</i> concentrations were observed during low tide, and abundances increased throughout the summer. We hypothesize that the warm shallow waters in estuarine mudflats facilitate the local growth of the <i>V. coralliilyticus</i> pathogen. Samples from larval oyster tanks in Whiskey Creek Shellfish Hatchery, which uses seawater pumped directly from Netarts Bay, contained significantly lower total <i>Vibrio</i> species concentrations, but roughly similar <i>V. coralliilyticus</i> concentrations, than did the bay water, resulting in a 30-fold increase in the relative abundance of the <i>V. coralliilyticus</i> pathogen in hatchery tanks. This suggests that the <i>V. coralliilyticus</i> pathogen is able to grow or persist under hatchery conditions.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> It has been argued that oyster-pathogenic <i>Vibrio</i> spp. have contributed to recent mortality events in U.S. shellfish hatcheries (R. A. Elston, H. Hasegawa, K. L. Humphrey, I. K. Polyak, and C. Haese, Dis Aquat Organ 82:119-134, 2008, https://doi.org/10.3354/dao01982); however, these events are often sporadic and unpredictable. The success of hatcheries is critically linked to the chemical and biological composition of inflowing seawater resources; thus, it is pertinent to understand the biogeochemical drivers of oyster-pathogenic <i>Vibrio</i> spp. in their planktonic state. Here, we show that Netarts Bay, the location of a local hatchery, is enriched in oyster-pathogenic <i>V. coralliilyticus</i> compared to coastal seawater, and we hypothesize that conditions in tidal flats promote the local growth of this pathogen. Furthermore, <i>V. coralliilyticus</i> appears to persist in seawater pumped into the local hatchery. These results improve our understanding of the ecology and environmental controls of the <i>V. coralliilyticus</i> pathogen and could be used to improve future aquaculture efforts, as multiple stressors impact hatchery success.
