study_name	A Comprehensive survey of Microbial Diversity in Hot Spring of Unai
study_abstract	In the present study, a high-throughput metagenomic sequencing of metagenomic DNA was performed on an Ion Torrent PGM platform for assessment of microbial diversity. Metagenome composed of 688,059 sequences with size 98,567,305 bps with an average length of 182 bps and 45% G+C content. MG-RAST community analysis revealed dominating Bacillus genus in bacterial domain. Remarkably, 20.5% sequences in a poorly characterized group, with versatile presence of commercial enzymes were marked in a functional metagenome analysis.
