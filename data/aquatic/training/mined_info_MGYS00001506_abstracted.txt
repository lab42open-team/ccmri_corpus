study_name	Monthly time-series analysis of the marine microbial community from surface to seafloor at the San Pedro Ocean Time-series station
study_abstract	This study primarily evaluates the monthly dynamics of the marine microbial community at the San Pedro Ocean Time-series station (SPOT; near Los Angeles, CA, USA). Other marine samples from two different locations in the San Pedro Channel (Pacific Ocean) have also been analyzed to compare the microbial communities to the SPOT station.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Mock communities have been used in microbiome method development to help estimate biases introduced in PCR amplification and sequencing and to optimize pipeline outputs. Nevertheless, the strong value of routine mock community analysis beyond initial method development is rarely, if ever, considered. Here we report that our routine use of mock communities as internal standards allowed us to discover highly aberrant and strong biases in the relative proportions of multiple taxa in a single Illumina HiSeqPE250 run. In this run, an important archaeal taxon virtually disappeared from all samples, and other mock community taxa showed &gt;2-fold high or low abundance, whereas a rerun of those identical amplicons (from the same reaction tubes) on a different date yielded "normal" results. Although obvious from the strange mock community results, we could have easily missed the problem had we not used the mock communities because of natural variation of microbiomes at our site. The "normal" results were validated over four MiSeqPE300 runs and three HiSeqPE250 runs, and run-to-run variation was usually low. While validating these "normal" results, we also discovered that some mock microbial taxa had relatively modest, but consistent, differences between sequencing platforms. We strongly advise the use of mock communities in every sequencing run to distinguish potentially serious aberrations from natural variations. The mock communities should have more than just a few members and ideally at least partly represent the samples being analyzed to detect problems that show up only in some taxa and also to help validate clustering. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Despite the routine use of standards and blanks in virtually all chemical or physical assays and most biological studies (a kind of "control"), microbiome analysis has traditionally lacked such standards. Here we show that unexpected problems of unknown origin can occur in such sequencing runs and yield completely incorrect results that would not necessarily be detected without the use of standards. Assuming that the microbiome sequencing analysis works properly every time risks serious errors that can be detected by the use of mock communities.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Marine archaea are critical contributors to global carbon and nitrogen redox cycles, but their temporal variability and microbial associations across the water column are poorly known. We evaluated seasonal variability of free living (0.2-1 mym size fraction) Thaumarchaea Marine Group I (MGI) and Euryarchaea Marine Group II (MGII) communities and their associations with the microbial community from surface to seafloor (890 m) over 5 years by 16S rRNA V4-V5 gene sequencing. MGI and MGII communities demonstrated distinct compositions at different depths, and seasonality at all depths. Microbial association networks at 150 m, 500 m and 890 m, revealed diverse assemblages of MGI (presumed ammonia oxidizers) and Nitrospina taxa (presumed dominant nitrite oxidizers, completing the nitrification process), suggesting distinct MGI-Nitrospina OTUs are responsible for nitrification at different depths and seasons, and depth- related and seasonal variability in nitrification could be affected by alternating MGI-Nitrospina assemblages. MGII taxa also showed distinct correlations to possibly heterotrophic bacteria, most commonly to members of Marine Group A, Chloroflexi, Marine Group B, and SAR86. Thus, both MGI and MGII likely have dynamic associations with bacteria based on similarities in activity or other interactions that select for distinct microbial assemblages over time. The importance of MGII taxa as members of the heterotrophic community previously reported for photic zone appears to apply throughout the water column.
