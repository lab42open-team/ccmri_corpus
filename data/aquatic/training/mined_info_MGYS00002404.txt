study_name	Yarwun Port Curtis Sediment Bacterial 16S rRNA (V6) 454 sequence
study_abstract	Samples were collected from the top 10cm of marine sediment from Port Curtis, Gladstone, Queensland, Australia. Sampling occurred over two tropical wet seasons (October to May) and two tropical dry seasons (June to September) between 2008 and 2010. Whole microbial DNA was extracted from subsamples and the V6 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing.
