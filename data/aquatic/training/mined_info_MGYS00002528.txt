study_name	Short-term interaction of pyrene and cadmium in prokaryotic community in coastal sediment microcosms
study_abstract	Acute ecological impact of co-contamination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals and their short-term interaction on diversity and composition of coastal benthic prokaryotes were unclear. We took pyrene (Pyr) and cadmium (Cd) as the representatives and mimicked an eight-week exposure of moderate and high levels of Pyr, Cd and their mixtures. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to investigate interaction of the contaminants in temporal succession of prokaryotes.
