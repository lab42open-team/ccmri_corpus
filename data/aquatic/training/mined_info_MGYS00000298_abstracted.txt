study_name	Substrate-controlled succession of distinct marine bacterioplankton populations induced by a spring phytoplankton bloom
study_abstract	Phytoplankton blooms characterize temperate ocean margin zones in spring and contribute substantially to their high productivity. We investigated the bacterioplankton response to a diatom bloom in the North Sea and observed an as yet unseen dynamic succession of thriving populations at genus level resolution. Taxonomically distinct expressions of carbohydrate-active enzymes, transporters (in particular TonB-dependent transporters) and phosphate acquisition systems were found, indicating that distinct populations of Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria acted like guilds specialized for successive algal-derived organic matter decomposition. Our results suggest that algal substrate availability and bacterial ecological niches determined the succession. A better understanding of such couplings between bacterioplankton and phytoplankton is needed to pave the way for predictive models of bacterioplankton bloom dynamics and thus more accurate global carbon turnover balances.

Our results suggest that algal substrate availability provided a series of ecological niches in which specialized populations could bloom. This reveals how planktonic species, despite their seemingly homogeneous habitat, can evade extinction by direct competition.
