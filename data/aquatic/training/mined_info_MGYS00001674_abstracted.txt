study_name	Detection and quantification of Pseudomonas species, including P. aeruginosa, in cooling tower water using a genus-specific Illumina-based approach
study_abstract	Pseudomonas species are frequent inhabitants of freshwater environments and often colonisers of water supply networks via bioadhesion and biofilm formation. P. aeruginosa is the most characterized species of the genus and the most commonly associated to human disease, causing a wide variety of infections that have causality links with their presence in freshwater systems. Though several other Pseudomonas species are of ecological and health importance, little knowledge regarding environmental Pseudomonas species still exists. In the present study, an Illumina-based approach using Pseudomonas genus-specific primers and targeting the 16S rRNA gene was validated and applied to a set of freshwater samples, collected from a cooling tower system during two years.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	<i>Pseudomonas</i> species are frequent inhabitants of freshwater environments and colonizers of water supply networks via bioadhesion and biofilm formation. <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is the species most commonly associated with human disease, causing a wide variety of infections with links to its presence in freshwater systems. Though several other <i>Pseudomonas</i> species are of ecological and public health importance, little knowledge exists regarding environmental abundances of these species. In the present study, an Illumina-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach using <i>Pseudomonas</i>-specific primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene was evaluated and applied to a set of freshwater samples from different environments including a cooling tower sampled monthly during 2 years. Our approach showed high <i>in situ</i> specificity and accuracy. NGS read counts revealed a precise quantification of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and a good correlation with the absolute number of <i>Pseudomonas</i> genome copies in a validated genus-specific qPCR assay, demonstrating the ability of the NGS approach to determine both relative and absolute abundances of <i>Pseudomonas</i> species and <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. The characterization of <i>Pseudomonas</i> communities in cooling tower water allowed us to identify 43 phylotypes, with <i>P. aeruginosa</i> being the most abundant. A shift existed within each year from a community dominated by phylotypes belonging to <i>P. fluorescens</i> and <i>P. oleovorans</i> phylogenetic groups to a community where <i>P. aeruginosa</i> was highly abundant. Co-occurrence was observed between <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and other phylotypes of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> group as well as the potentially pathogenic species <i>P. stutzeri</i>, but not with phylotypes of the <i>P. fluorescens</i> group, indicating the need to further investigate the metabolic networks and ecological traits of <i>Pseudomonas</i> species. This study demonstrates the potential of deep sequencing as a valuable tool in environmental diagnostics and surveillance of health-related pathogens in freshwater environments.
