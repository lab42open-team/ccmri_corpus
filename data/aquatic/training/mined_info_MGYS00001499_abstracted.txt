study_name	The San Pedro Ocean time-series is a marine time-series started circa 1997. This project aims to study ecological and biogeochemical implications of global marine microbial biodiversity.
study_abstract	The USC Microbial Observatory (Jed Fuhrman and David Caron, PIs) focuses on exploratory investigation of prokaryotic and unicellular eukaryotic diversity in the San Pedro Channel , California, with an initial focus on time-dependent changes in community composition in relation to environmental parameters. It also includes focused studies of particular microbial groups. We are currently in 12th year of this project. Our primary sampling site is located midway between Los Angeles and the USC Wrigley Marine Laboratory on Santa Catalina approximately 900 m of water. This site is visited monthly by ship for sampling to 500 m depth. Additional sampling is conducted on an ad hoc basis in coastal water near the lab on Catalina Island.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Network analyses, such as of gene co-expression networks, metabolic networks and ecological networks have become a central approach for the systems-level study of biological data. Several software packages exist for generating and analyzing such networks, either from correlation scores or the absolute value of a transformed score called weighted topological overlap (wTO). However, since gene regulatory processes can up- or down-regulate genes, it is of great interest to explicitly consider both positive and negative correlations when constructing a gene co-expression network. Here, we present an R package for calculating the weighted topological overlap (wTO), that, in contrast to existing packages, explicitly addresses the sign of the wTO values, and is thus especially valuable for the analysis of gene regulatory networks. The package includes the calculation of p-values (raw and adjusted) for each pairwise gene score. Our package also allows the calculation of networks from time series (without replicates). Since networks from independent datasets (biological repeats or related studies) are not the same due to technical and biological noise in the data, we additionally, incorporated a novel method for calculating a consensus network (CN) from two or more networks into our R package. To graphically inspect the resulting networks, the R package contains a visualization tool, which allows for the direct network manipulation and access of node and link information. When testing the package on a standard laptop computer, we can conduct all calculations for systems of more than 20,000 genes in under two hours. We compare our new wTO package to state of art packages and demonstrate the application of the wTO and CN functions using 3 independently derived datasets from healthy human pre-frontal cortex samples. To showcase an example for the time series application we utilized a metagenomics data set. In this work, we developed a software package that allows the computation of wTO networks, CNs and a visualization tool in the R statistical environment. It is publicly available on CRAN repositories under the GPL -2 Open Source License ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wTO/ ).

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Numerous ecological processes, such as bacteriophage infection and phytoplankton-bacterial interactions, often occur via strain-specific mechanisms. Therefore, studying the causes of microbial dynamics should benefit from highly resolving taxonomic characterizations. We sampled daily to weekly over 5 months following a phytoplankton bloom off Southern California and examined the extent of microdiversity, that is, significant variation within 99% sequence similarity clusters, operational taxonomic units (OTUs), of bacteria, archaea, phytoplankton chloroplasts (all via 16S or intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences) and T4-like-myoviruses (via g23 major capsid protein gene sequence). The extent of microdiversity varied between genes (ITS most, g23 least) and only temporally common taxa were highly microdiverse. Overall, 60% of taxa exhibited microdiversity; 59% of these had subtypes that changed significantly as a proportion of the parent taxon, indicating ecologically distinct taxa. Pairwise correlations between prokaryotes and myoviruses or phytoplankton (for example, highly microdiverse Chrysochromulina sp.) improved when using single-base variants. Correlations between myoviruses and SAR11 increased in number (172 vs 9, Spearman&gt;0.65) and became stronger (0.61 vs 0.58, t-test: P&lt;0.001) when using SAR11 ITS single-base variants vs OTUs. Whole-community correlation between SAR11 and myoviruses was much improved when using ITS single-base variants vs OTUs, with Mantel rho=0.49 vs 0.27; these results are consistent with strain-specific interactions. Mantel correlations suggested &gt;1 mym (attached/large) prokaryotes are a major myovirus source. Consideration of microdiversity improved observation of apparent host and virus networks, and provided insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors influencing the success of lineages, with important implications to ecosystem resilience and microbial function.
