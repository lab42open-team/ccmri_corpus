study_name	Metagenomic exploration of Lasundra hot spring
study_abstract	Geothermal areas are the main permanent hot places of the world, and these areas are the major habitats of thermophilic bacteria. In culture independent method, metagenome was isolated using manual and kit based methods. The short gun sequencing of metagenome was performed using Ion torrent PGM platform. The analysis of sequencing data revealed that this spring is dominated by bacterial taxa. MG-RAST based community analysis showed that bacteria were found in dominancy with 99.2% in domain hit distribution. Firmicutes were found to be dominant in domain hit classification followed by proteobacteria. Moreover, unclassified sequences also found in this metagenome indicate there are possibilities of getting novel organisms.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	This is the first report on the metagenomic approach for unveiling the microbial diversity of Lasundra hot spring, Gujarat State, India. High-throughput sequencing of community DNA was performed on an Ion Torrent PGM platform. Metagenome consisted of 606,867 sequences represent 98,567,305 bps size with an average length of 162 bps and 46% G + C content. Metagenome sequence information is available at EBI under EBI Metagenomic database with accession no. ERP009313. MG-RAST assisted community analysis revealed that 99.21% sequences were bacterial origin, 0.43% was fit to eukaryotes and 0.11% belongs to archaea. A total of 29 bacterial, 20 eukaryotic and 4 archaeal phyla were detected. Abundant genera were Bacillus (86.7%), Geobacillus (2.4%), Paenibacillus (1.0%), Clostridium (0.7%) and Listeria (0.5%), that represent 91.52% in metagenome. In functional analysis, Cluster of Orthologous Group (COG) based annotation revealed that 45.4% was metabolism connected and 19.6% falls in poorly characterized group. Subsystem based annotation approach suggests that the 14.0% was carbohydrates, 7.0% was protein metabolism and 3.0% genes for various stress responses together with the versatile presence of commercially useful traits.
