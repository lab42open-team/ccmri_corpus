study_name	Peru Margin Subseafloor Biosphere
study_abstract	The subseafloor marine biosphere may be one of the largest reserviors of microbial biomass on Earth and has recently been the subject of debate in terms of the composition of its microbial inhabitants, particularly on sediments from the Peru Margin. A metagenomic analysis was made using whole genome amplification and pyrosequencing of sediments from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1229 on the Peru Margin to further explore the microbial diversity and overall community composition within this environment. A total of 61.9 Megabases of genetic material was sequenced from sediments at horizons 1, 16, 32 and 50 meters below seafloor. These depths include sediments from both primarily sulfate-reducing and also methane-generating regions of the sediment column. Many genes of the annotated genes, including those encoding ribosomal proteins, corresponded to those from the Chloroflexi and Euryarchaeota. However, analysis of the 16S small subunit ribosomal genes suggests that Crenarchaeota are the abundant microbial member. Quantitative PCR confirms that uncultivated Crenarchaeota are indeed a major microbial group in these subsurface samples. These findings show that the marine subsurface is a distinct microbial habitat and is different than environments previously studied by metagenomics, especially due to the predominance of uncultivated archaeal groups.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	The Brazos-Trinity Basin on the slope of the Gulf of Mexico passive margin was drilled during Integrated Ocean Drilling Progam Expedition 308. The buried anaerobic sediments of this basin are largely organic-poor and have few microbial inhabitants compared with the organic-rich sediments with high cell counts from the Peru Margin that were drilled during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 201. Nucleic acids were extracted from Brazos-Trinity Basin sediments and were subjected to whole-genome amplification and pyrosequencing. A comparison of the Brazos-Trinity Basin metagenome, consisting of 105 Mbp, and the existing Peru Margin metagenome revealed trends linking gene content, phylogenetic content, geological location and geochemical regime. The major microbial groups (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Euryarchaeota and Chloroflexi) occur consistently throughout all samples, yet their shifting abundances allow for discrimination between samples. The cluster of orthologous groups category abundances for some classes of genes are correlated with geochemical factors, such as the level of ammonia. Here we describe the sediment metagenome from the oligotrophic Brazos-Trinity Basin (Site 1320) and show similarities and differences with the dataset from the Pacific Peru Margin (Site 1229) and other pyrosequenced datasets. The microbial community found at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site 1320 likely represents the subsurface microbial inhabitants of turbiditic slopes that lack substantial upwelling.

publication_nr_2_pubmed_abstract	The community compositions of Bacteria and Archaea were investigated in deep, sub-seafloor sediments from the highly productive Peru Margin (ODP Leg 201, sites 1228 and 1229, c. 25 km apart) down to nearly 200 m below the seafloor using taxonomic (16S rRNA) and functional (mcrA and dsrA) gene markers. Bacterial and archaeal groups identified from clone libraries of 16S rRNA gene sequences at site 1229 agreed well with sequences amplified from bands excised from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) depth profiles, with the exception of the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group (MCG). This suggested that the prokaryotic community at site 1228, obtained from DGGE profiling alone, was reliable. Sites were dominated by Bacteria in the Gammaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi (green non-sulphur bacteria) and Archaea in the MCG and South African Gold Mine Euryarchaeotic Group, although community composition changed with depth. The candidate division JS1 was present throughout both sites but was not dominant. The populations identified in the Peru Margin sediments consisted mainly of prokaryotes found in other deep subsurface sediments, and were more similar to communities from the Sea of Okhotsk (pelagic clays) than to those from the low organic carbon Nankai Trough sediments. Despite broad similarities in the prokaryotic community at the two sites, there were some differences, as well as differences in activity and geochemistry. Methanogens (mcrA) within the Methanosarcinales and Methanobacteriales were only found at site 1229 (4 depths analysed), whereas sulphate-reducing prokaryotes (dsrA) were only found at site 1228 (one depth), and these terminal-oxidizing prokaryotes may represent an active community component present at low abundance. This study clearly demonstrates that the deep subsurface sediments of the Peru Margin have a large diverse and metabolically active prokaryotic population.
