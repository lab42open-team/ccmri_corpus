study_abstract	Here we describe microbial community dynamics in the GOMOO mesocosm experiment. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of filtered water samples collected every 12 hours from the mesocosm treatments, we characterized community membership and structure to determine how the mesocosm communities responded to the water accomdated fraction of oil with and without the dispersant Corexit.
