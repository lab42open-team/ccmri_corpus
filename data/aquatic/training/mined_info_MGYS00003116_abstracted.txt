study_abstract	Previous studies of microbial abundance and geochemistry in deep marine sediments indicate a stimulation of microbial activity near the sediment-basement interface. Furthermore, the few studies thus far conducted in deep oceanic crust reveal an active microbial community in this habitat. Yet, the extent to which microbial communities in bottom sediments and underlying crustal habitats interact is unclear. Are microbial communities in sediments seeded from basement communities, or vice versa? If there is influence from one habitat type on the other, how far does this influence extend, both with vertical distance away from the interface and laterally along the flow path of fluids within basement? We propose to conduct tag pyrosequencing on samples from a spectrum of sediment-basement habitats to identify patterns in microbial community shifts across sediment-basement interfaces. Such comparisons will allow us to evaluate whether microbial groups from one habitat are found in another, and to examine whether members of the ''rare biosphere'' in one habitat come to dominate in another. Analysis of the pyrosequencing data will help us better understand how subsurface microbial communities are established and evolve, in addition to expanding our knowledge of microbial biogeography across sediment-basement interfaces in different oceanic basins.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Microbial communities living in deeply buried sediment may be adapted to long-term energy limitation as they are removed from new detrital energy inputs for thousands to millions of years. However, sediment layers near the underlying oceanic crust may receive inputs from below that influence microbial community structure and/or activity. As part of the Census of Deep Life, we used 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing on DNA extracted from a spectrum of deep sediment-basement interface samples from the subsurface of the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank (collected on IODP Expedition 327) to examine this possible basement influence on deep sediment communities. This area experiences rapid sedimentation, with an underlying basaltic crust that hosts a dynamic flux of hydrothermal fluids that diffuse into the sediment. Chloroflexi sequences dominated tag libraries in all sediment samples, with variation in the abundance of other bacterial groups (e.g., Actinobacteria, Aerophobetes, Atribacteria, Planctomycetes, and Nitrospirae). These variations occur in relation to the type of sediment (clays versus carbonate-rich) and the depth of sample origin, and show no clear connection to the distance from the discharge outcrop or to basement fluid microbial communities. Actinobacteria-related sequences dominated the basalt libraries, but these should be viewed cautiously due to possibilities for imprinting from contamination. Our results indicate that proximity to basement or areas of seawater recharge is not a primary driver of microbial community composition in basal sediment, even though fluids diffusing from basement into sediment may stimulate microbial activity.
