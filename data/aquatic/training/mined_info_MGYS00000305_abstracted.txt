study_name	Detoxification of arsenic mediated by microbial sulphate reduction in Mediterranean marine sediments
study_abstract	Micro-organisms which dwell in sediments have a crucial role in biogeochemical cycles and are thus expected to have a strong influence on the cycle of arsenic, a metalloid responsible for severe water pollution and presenting a major health risk for the populations. Nowadays, environmental genomics techniques allow to study the adaptive and cooperative strategies of microbial communities thriving in polluted environments.We sequenced the sediment metagenomes from l'Estaque marina (Marseille, France), close to a former metallurgic industrial site highly polluted with arsenic, and from St Mandrier marina, near Toulon (France). The functional and taxonomic profiles of both metagenomes, along with those from four publicly available metagenomes used as control data sets, were obtained using the RAMMCAP workflow.The biodiversity was higher in both harbour sediment communities in comparison to the controls. The order of Desulfobacterales represented 54.7% of the observed orders in l'Estaque and 31.7% in St Mandrier. Other orders were evenly distributed though the diversity was lower in the highly polluted site of l'Estaque than in St Mandrier. The Gene Ontology (GO) entries describing the functional profiles were compared with the controls in order to highlight the over-represented categories in the metagenomes of interest. We observed that categories related to arsenic resistance and oxidative stress were over-represented in l'Estaque. More importantly, the integration of metagenomic and physico-chemical data showed that in l'Estaque, dissimilatory sulphate reduction in the upper layer of sediment could increase arsenic diffusion to the water column and deeper layers, resulting in local detoxification of the sediment.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Several technical challenges in metagenomic data analysis, including assembling metagenomic sequence data or identifying operational taxonomic units, are both significant and well known. These forms of analysis are increasingly cited as conceptually flawed, given the extreme variation within traditionally defined species and rampant horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, computational requirements of such analysis have hindered content-based organization of metagenomic data at large scale. In this article, we introduce the Amordad database engine for alignment-free, content-based indexing of metagenomic datasets. Amordad places the metagenome comparison problem in a geometric context, and uses an indexing strategy that combines random hashing with a regular nearest neighbor graph. This framework allows refinement of the database over time by continual application of random hash functions, with the effect of each hash function encoded in the nearest neighbor graph. This eliminates the need to explicitly maintain the hash functions in order for query efficiency to benefit from the accumulated randomness. Results on real and simulated data show that Amordad can support logarithmic query time for identifying similar metagenomes even as the database size reaches into the millions.
