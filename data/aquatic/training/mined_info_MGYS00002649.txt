study_name	ADDOMEx Tier 3 Experiments: Mesocosm Si with Gulf of Mexico coastal waters
study_abstract	Here we describe microbial community dynamics in the Mesocosm-Si experiment. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of filtered water samples collected every 24 hours from the mesocosm treatments, we characterized community membership and structure to determine how the mesocosm communities responded to a passively dosed (via silicone tubing) water accomdated fraction of oil.
