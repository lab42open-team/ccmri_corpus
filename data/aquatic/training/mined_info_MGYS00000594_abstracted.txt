study_name	Antimicrobial resistance gene monitoring in aquatic environments
study_abstract	This dissertation documents the development of an environmental framework for monitoring antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) dissemination in the aquatic environment. The work opens with a review of the relevant literature and outlines the importance of an environmental framework for monitoring ARG dissemination as part of antimicrobial resistance risk assessments. The ability to interrogate sequencing data quickly and easily for the presence of ARGs is crucial in order to facilitate their monitoring in the environment. As current laboratory methods for the detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in the environment were limited in their effectiveness and scope, the dissertation begins by describing the design and implementation of a Search Engine for Antimicrobial Resistance (SEAR), a pipeline and web interface for detection of horizontally-acquired ARGs in raw sequencing data. The suitability of metagenomic methods for monitoring the ARG content of effluents from faecal sources was then assessed via a pilot study of a river catchment. Novel metagenomes generated from effluents entering the catchment were interrogated for ARGs. The relative abundance of ARGs in effluents were determined to be higher relative to the background environment, as were sequences relating to human and animal pathogens and mobile genetic elements. Thus, effluents were implicated in the dissemination of ARGs throughout the aquatic environment. To determine if ARGs were potentially in use in the environment, the expression of ARGs within effluents was then evaluated across a series of longitudinal samples through the use of metatranscriptomics, and the presence of potential environmental antimicrobial selection pressures was examined. This demonstrated that the abundance of ARGs, as well as antimicrobial usage at the effluent source, was correlated with the transcription of ARGs in aquatic environments. The work described in this dissertation has also found that horizontally transmitted ARGs were present in pathogenic endospore-forming bacteria commonly found across the aquatic environment, potentially providing a mechanism for ARG persistence in the environment. Finally, these findings were integrated into a universal framework for monitoring ARG dissemination in aquatic environments and used to highlight the developments required to incorporate this framework into future environmental ARG research and to facilitate antimicrobial resistance risk assessments.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Effluents contain a diverse abundance of antibiotic resistance genes that augment the resistome of receiving aquatic environments. However, uncertainty remains regarding their temporal persistence, transcription and response to anthropogenic factors, such as antibiotic usage. We present a spatiotemporal study within a river catchment (River Cam, UK) that aims to determine the contribution of antibiotic resistance gene-containing effluents originating from sites of varying antibiotic usage to the receiving environment. Gene abundance in effluents (municipal hospital and dairy farm) was compared against background samples of the receiving aquatic environment (i.e. the catchment source) to determine the resistome contribution of effluents. We used metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to correlate DNA and RNA abundance and identified differentially regulated gene transcripts. We found that mean antibiotic resistance gene and transcript abundances were correlated for both hospital ( p = 0.9, two-tailed P &lt;0.0001) and farm ( p = 0.5, two-tailed P &lt;0.0001) effluents and that two Beta-lactam resistance genes ( bla GES and bla OXA ) were overexpressed in all hospital effluent samples. High Beta-lactam resistance gene transcript abundance was related to hospital antibiotic usage over time and hospital effluents contained antibiotic residues. We conclude that effluents contribute high levels of antibiotic resistance genes to the aquatic environment; these genes are expressed at significant levels and are possibly related to the level of antibiotic usage at the effluent source.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Antimicrobial resistance remains a growing and significant concern in human and veterinary medicine. Current laboratory methods for the detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistant bacteria are limited in their effectiveness and scope. With the rapidly developing field of whole genome sequencing beginning to be utilised in clinical practice, the ability to interrogate sequencing data quickly and easily for the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes will become increasingly important and useful for informing clinical decisions. Additionally, use of such tools will provide insight into the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance genes in metagenomic samples such as those used in environmental monitoring. Here we present the Search Engine for Antimicrobial Resistance (SEAR), a pipeline and web interface for detection of horizontally acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in raw sequencing data. The pipeline provides gene information, abundance estimation and the reconstructed sequence of antimicrobial resistance genes; it also provides web links to additional information on each gene. The pipeline utilises clustering and read mapping to annotate full-length genes relative to a user-defined database. It also uses local alignment of annotated genes to a range of online databases to provide additional information. We demonstrate SEAR's application in the detection and abundance estimation of antimicrobial resistance genes in two novel environmental metagenomes, 32 human faecal microbiome datasets and 126 clinical isolates of Shigella sonnei. We have developed a pipeline that contributes to the improved capacity for antimicrobial resistance detection afforded by next generation sequencing technologies, allowing for rapid detection of antimicrobial resistance genes directly from sequencing data. SEAR uses raw sequencing data via an intuitive interface so can be run rapidly without requiring advanced bioinformatic skills or resources. Finally, we show that SEAR is effective in detecting antimicrobial resistance genes in metagenomic and isolate sequencing data from both environmental metagenomes and sequencing data from clinical isolates.
