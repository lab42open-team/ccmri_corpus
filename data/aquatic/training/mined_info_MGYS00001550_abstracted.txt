study_name	Microbial community response during the iron fertilization experiment LOHAFEX
study_abstract	Iron fertilization experiments in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll areas are known to induce phytoplankton blooms. However, little is known about the response of the microbial community upon iron fertilization. As part of the LOHAFEX experiment in the southern Atlantic Ocean, Bacteria and Archaea were monitored within and outside an induced bloom, dominated by Phae- ocystis-like nanoplankton, during the 38 days of the experiment. The microbial production increased 1.6-fold (thymidine up- take) and 2.1-fold (leucine uptake), while total cell numbers increased only slightly over the course of the experiment. 454 tag pyrosequencing of partial 16S rRNA genes and catalyzed reporter deposition ???uorescence in situ hybridization (CARD FISH) showed that the composition and abundance of the bacterial and archaeal community in the iron-fertilized water body were re- markably constant without development of typical bloom-related succession patterns. Members of groups usually found in phy- toplankton blooms, such as Roseobacter and Gammaproteobacteria, showed no response or only a minor response to the bloom. However, sequence numbers and total cell numbers of the SAR11 and SAR86 clades increased slightly but signi???cantly toward the end of the experiment. It seems that although microbial productivity was enhanced within the fertilized area, a succession- like response of the microbial community upon the algal bloom was averted by highly effective grazing. Only small-celled mem- bers like the SAR11 and SAR86 clades could possibly escape the grazing pressure, explaining a net increase of those clades in numbers.
