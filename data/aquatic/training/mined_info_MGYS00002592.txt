study_abstract	Submarine groundwater must pass through an Fe-mineralized barrier before being discharged to coastal environments. Our goal was to assay the microbial members of this subsurface aquifer environment, looking at both pore water and surface sediments from a shore-perpendicular transect down to 4 m depth.
