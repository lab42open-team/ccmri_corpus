study_abstract	A study on metagenomic soil was conducted under the long-term managements till and conventional tillage in crop rotation and succession in an experimental area of Embrapa Soja. The objective was to identify the genetic diversity and biotechnological potential of microorganisms and to compare the microbial communities of soils which may thus infer about the sustainability of different management systems.
