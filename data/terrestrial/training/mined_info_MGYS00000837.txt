study_abstract	Natural soil bacteria selectively transported by seepage water are revealed to resemble root-associated microbiota. Mechanisms of mobilisation and transport appear related to preferential flow. Mobilised bacterial biomass carbon represents only a minor contribution to overall organic carbon flux. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene pyrotags from depth resolved soil and seepage water samples from a maize field near Gottingen, Germany. Sampled in January 2010.
