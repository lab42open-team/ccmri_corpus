study_name	Metagenome sequencing of DNA-SIP heavy fractions
study_abstract	Soil from the former coking plant in Neuves-Maisons (France) was amended with 13C-phenanthrene, in two conditions, namely bare soil or planted with ryegrass. After ten days, DNA was extracted from soil and separated on cesium chloride gradient. Fractions containing 13C-labeled DNA were sequenced using PE250 MiSeq technology.
