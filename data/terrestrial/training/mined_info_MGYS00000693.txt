study_name	Soil microbial diversity of 106 samples Metagenome
study_abstract	These data contain the information about the response of soil bacterial diversity and composition to multi-factorial environmental changes, including increased precipitation, rising temperature, adding nitrogen, adding phosphorus, removing plant functional groups, grazing, and some of their combination. Specifically, C8,C10,C12,C32 and C33 represent the treatment of removing no plant functional group; C5,C6,C9,C11,C13,C14,C21,C22,C23,C24,C25,C28,C29,C39 and C40 represent the treatment of removing one plant functional group; C1,C2,C4,C7,C17,C18,C19,C20,C26,C3,C30,C34,C35,C36 and C38 represent the treatment of removing two plant functional groups; and C15,C16,C27,C31,C37 represent the treatment of removing three plant functional groups. Meanwhile, D16,D23,D32,D40,D47,D51 and D64 represent the control; D18,D19,D46,D55,D60 and D9 represent the treatment of warming; D22,D36,D38,D41,D42,D56 and D57 represent the treatment of watering; D15,D31,D37,D39,D4 and D50 represent the treatment of simultaneous warming and watering; D21,D26,D58 and D63 represent the treatment of adding phosphorus; D30,D34,D49 and D65 represent the treatment of adding nitrogen; D14,D35,D45 and D5 represent the treatment of simultaneous adding N and watering; D17,D48,D54 and D6 represent the treatment of simultaneous adding N and P; D25,D62,D66 and D8 represent the treatment of grazing; D11,D2,D43 and D59 represent the treatment of simultaneous grazing and watering; D10,D29,D3 and D44 represent the treatment of simultaneous grazing and adding P; D27,D28,D33 and D7 represent the treatment of simultaneous grazing and adding N; D1,D12,D20 and D52 represent the treatment of simultaneous grazing and adding N and watering; D13,D24,D53 and D61 represent the treatment of simultaneous grazing and adding N and P.
