publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Hypersaline aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems display a cosmopolitan distribution. These environments teem with microbes and harbor a plethora of prokaryotic lineages that evaded ecological characterization due to the prior inability to cultivate them or to access their genomic information. In order to close the current knowledge gap, we performed two sampling and isolation campaigns in the saline soils of the Odiel Saltmarshes and the salterns of Isla Cristina (Huelva, Spain). From the isolated haloarchaeal strains subjected to high-throughput phylogenetic screening, two were chosen (F15B<sup>T</sup> and F9-27<sup>T</sup>) for physiological and genomic characterization due of their relatedness to the genus <i>Halonotius</i>. Comparative genomic analyses were carried out between the isolated strains and the genomes of previously described species <i>Halonotius pteroides</i> CECT 7525<sup>T</sup>, <i>Halonotius aquaticus</i> F13-13<sup>T</sup> and environmentaly recovered metagenome-assembled representatives of the genus <i>Halonotius</i>. The topology of the phylogenomic tree showed agreement with the phylogenetic ones based on 16S rRNA and <i>rpoB'</i> genes, and together with average amino acid and nucleotide identities suggested the two strains as novel species within the genus. We propose the names <i>Halonotius terrestris</i> sp. nov. (type strain F15B<sup>T</sup> = CECT 9688<sup>T</sup> = CCM 8954<sup>T</sup>) and <i>Halonotius roseus</i> sp. nov. (type strain F9-27<sup>T</sup> = CECT 9745<sup>T</sup> = CCM 8956<sup>T</sup>) for these strains. Comparative genomic analyses within the genus highlighted a typical <i>salt-in</i> signature, characterized by acidic proteomes with low isoelectric points, and indicated heterotrophic aerobic lifestyles. Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions revealed that the newly proposed species encode all the necessary enzymatic reactions involved in cobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) biosynthesis. Based on the worldwide distribution of the genus and its abundance in hypersaline habitats we postulate that its members perform a critical function by being able to provide "expensive" commodities (i.e., vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) to the halophilic microbial communities at large.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	We report Metagenome from the saline desert soil sample of Little Rann of Kutch, Gujarat State, India. Metagenome consisted of 633,760 sequences with size 141,307,202 bp and 56% G + C content. Metagenome sequence data are available at EBI under EBI Metagenomics database with accession no. ERP005612. Community metagenomics revealed total 1802 species belonged to 43 different phyla with dominating Marinobacter (48.7%) and Halobacterium (4.6%) genus in bacterial and archaeal domain respectively. Remarkably, 18.2% sequences in a poorly characterized group and 4% gene for various stress responses along with versatile presence of commercial enzyme were evident in a functional metagenome analysis.
