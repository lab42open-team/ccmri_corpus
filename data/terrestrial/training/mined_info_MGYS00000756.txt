study_name	Linuron contamination of an on-farm biopurification system
study_abstract	Response of the bacterial community in an on-farm biopurification system to linuron contamination studied in several microcosms. Soil from an on-farm biopurification system was kept as six microcosms with stable temperature and moisture for 25 days. Three of the six samples were treated with the pesticide linuron (25 mg/g) to select for linuron degrading bacteria and plasmids.
