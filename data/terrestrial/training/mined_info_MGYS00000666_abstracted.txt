study_abstract	Soil microbial communities are among the most diverse and complex environments in the world. Our information about the identity and metabolic capabilities of terrestrial microbes is still scarce. Moreover, although microorganisms in soil are essential for nitrogen, carbon, phosphorous and sulfur cycling as well as plant growth and crop production, only a few microbial species involved in these processes have been described in detail. The future years will face the challenge of increasing agricultural yields conserving soil microbial communities and soil quality. To do so, a better comprehension of micro-ecosystem functioning and microbial description will be needed. As a first modest approach towards the understanding of soil microbial communities and how land use affects them, we have generated a metagenomic dataset obtained by high throughput sequencing of samples from Argentinean Pampas. Three different geographic regions, three different types of land uses and two soil types (bulk and rhizospheric) were analyzed using whole genome shotgun (WGS) and amplicon sequencing. A total of 19 Mi (7.7 Gb) WGS reads and over 1 Mi 16 rRNA pyrotags were generated. Our preliminary results suggest that soil microbial communities are different at both, taxonomic and metabolic level, on each type of tillage system and geographic region in bulk soils. Rhizospheric microbial communities resulted markedly different from those in bulk soils and less sensitive to the type of tillage system. This dataset is the first soil metagenomic study in Argentina and one of the few available in the world. This should be considered as a kick-start for future efforts towards a better comprehension of soil microbial communities in agricultural systems in the Argentinean region and a useful comparison dataset for other regions in the world.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Soil is among the most diverse and complex environments in the world. Soil microorganisms play an essential role in biogeochemical cycles and affect plant growth and crop production. However, our knowledge of the relationship between species-assemblies and soil ecosystem processes is still very limited. The aim of this study was to generate a comprehensive metagenomic survey to evaluate the effect of high-input agricultural practices on soil microbial communities. We collected soil samples from three different areas in the Argentinean Pampean region under three different types of land uses and two soil sources (bulk and rhizospheric). We extracted total DNA from all samples and also synthetized cDNA from rhizospheric samples. Using 454-FLX technology, we generated 112 16S ribosomal DNA and 14 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon libraries totaling 1.3 M reads and 36 shotgun metagenome libraries totaling 17.8 million reads (7.7 GB). Our preliminary results suggested that water availability could be the primary driver that defined microbial assemblages over land use and soil source. However, when water was not a limiting resource (annual precipitation &gt;800 mm) land use was a primary driver. This was the first metagenomic study of soil conducted in Argentina and our datasets are among the few large soil datasets publicly available. The detailed analysis of these data will provide a step forward in our understanding of how soil microbiomes respond to high-input agricultural systems, and they will serve as a useful comparison with other soil metagenomic studies worldwide.
