study_name	Composition and structure of soil fungal community in Inner Mongolian steppe
study_abstract	Fungi serve important roles in terrestrial ecosystem. However, its geographic distribution and driving factors shaping fungal community structure remain elusive. In this study, we utilized Illumina Miseq sequencing technique for the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region to investigate soil fungal distribution along a 360-km transect in Inner Mongolian steppe.
