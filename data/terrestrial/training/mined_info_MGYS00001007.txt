study_name	Microorganisms responsible for carbon uptake from ethylbenzene and its degradation products
study_abstract	This study aimed at identifying microorganisms that are involved in the carbon uptake from ethylbenzene and its degradation products in soil microcosms. These microcosms were determined by combing stable isotope probing and high throughput sequencing techniques. Briefly total genomic DNA was extracted from microcosms that degraded approximately 80% of the added labeled or unlabeled ethylbenzene and was subject to gradient ultracentrifugation and were divided into fractions for further analysis. Heavy fractions and total genomic DNA samples from all microcosms were sampled. This BioProject contains the illumina sequences generated from the total genomic DNA samples from all microcosms.
