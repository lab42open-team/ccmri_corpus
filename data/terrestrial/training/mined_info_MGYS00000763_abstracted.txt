study_name	Soil fungal communities and their contributions to SOM cycling
study_abstract	Quantifying the contribution of EM mycelia to SOM turnover is of critical importance to carbon models . In this study, we evaluated a system to trap enzymatically active EM hyphae under field conditions. Natural-substrate filled mesh bags, surrounded by a sand barrier were effective at trapping EM hyphae while minimizing colonization by obligate saprotrophic fungi. The generated fungal communities were similar in composition to those in the surrounding fermentation/humus layer at both trophic and higher taxonomic levels. Consequently, this system allowed us to study the contribution of EMF mycelia to soil enzyme activity and to SOM-C cycling.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Soils of northern temperate and boreal forests represent a large terrestrial carbon (C) sink. The fate of this C under elevated atmospheric CO2 and climate change is still uncertain. A fundamental knowledge gap is the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) and saprotrophic fungi contribute to C cycling in the systems by soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. In this study, we used a novel approach to generate and compare enzymatically active EMF hyphae-dominated and saprotrophic hyphae-enriched communities under field conditions. Fermentation-humus (FH)-filled mesh bags, surrounded by a sand barrier, effectively trapped EMF hyphae with a community structure comparable to that found in the surrounding FH layer, at both trophic and taxonomic levels. In contrast, over half the sequences from mesh bags with no sand barrier were identified as belonging to saprotrophic fungi. The EMF hyphae-dominated systems exhibited levels of hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities that were comparable to or higher than saprotroph-enriched systems. The enzymes assayed included those associated with both labile and recalcitrant SOM degradation. Our study shows that EMF hyphae are likely important contributors to current SOM turnover in sub-boreal systems. Our results also suggest that any increased EMF biomass that might result from higher below-ground C allocation by trees would not suppress C fluxes from sub-boreal soils.
