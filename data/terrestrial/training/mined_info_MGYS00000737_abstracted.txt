study_name	The Island Project - Fungal communities in boreal forest soils
study_abstract	This project investigates fungal communities in fine-scaled organic soil profiles in a long-term chronosequence of boreal forests. The forests are situated on 30 islands in the two lakes Hornavan and Uddjaure, in northern Sweden. The islands have burned with different frequency due to their different area to intercept lightning, and the forests represent a successional gradient ranging from 50 to 5000 years in age. The current project seeks to unravel the mechanisms for the observed long-term build-up of carbon in the organic soil profiles in the islands. It is highly relevant to increase understanding of these mechanisms to be able to adequately predict effects of climate change, forest management practices and other environmental changes on the large carbon stocks currently stored in boreal forest soils. Fungal ITS2 amplicons from organic soil profiles from boreal forest chronosequence.

publication_nr_1_pubmed_abstract	Fungi have crucial roles in ecosystems, and are important associates for many organisms. They are adapted to a wide variety of habitats, however their global distribution and diversity remains poorly documented. The exponential growth of DNA barcode information retrieved from the environment is assisting considerably the traditional ways for unraveling fungal diversity and detection. The raw DNA data in association to environmental descriptors of metabarcoding studies are made available in public sequence read archives. While this is potentially a valuable source of information for the investigation of Fungi across diverse environmental conditions, the annotation used to describe environment is heterogenous. Moreover, a uniform processing pipeline still needs to be applied to the available raw DNA data. Hence, a comprehensive framework to analyses these data in a large context is still lacking. We introduce the MycoDiversity DataBase, a database which includes public fungal metabarcoding data of environmental samples for the study of biodiversity patterns of Fungi. The framework we propose will contribute to our understanding of fungal biodiversity and aims to become a valuable source for large-scale analyses of patterns in space and time, in addition to assisting evolutionary and ecological research on Fungi.
