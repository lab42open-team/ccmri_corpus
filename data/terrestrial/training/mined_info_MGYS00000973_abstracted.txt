publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Purple prairie clover (PPC; <i>Dalea purpurea</i> Vent.) containing 84.5 g/kg dry matter (DM) of condensed tannin (CT) was ensiled without (control) or with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for 76 days, followed by 14 days of aerobic exposure. Changes in fermentation characteristics were determined, and the composition of bacterial and fungal communities were assessed using metagenomic sequencing. The addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) that deactivated CT at ensiling increased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05 to ~0.001) soluble N, nonprotein N, lactic acid, total volatile fatty acids, ammonia N, deoxynivalenol (DON), and ochratoxin A (OTA) but decreased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) pH and water-soluble carbohydrates. The concentrations of DON and OTA increased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) for both silages, with the extent of increase being greater for control than for PEG-treated silage during aerobic exposure. The PEG-treated silage exhibited higher (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01 to ~0.001) copy numbers of total bacteria, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, yeasts, and fungi than the control. The addition of PEG decreased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) bacterial diversity during both ensiling and aerobic exposure, whereas it increased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) fungal diversity during aerobic exposure. The addition of PEG at ensiling increased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) the abundances of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Pediococcus</i> species but decreased (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) the abundances of <i>Lactococcus</i> and <i>Leuconostoc</i> species. Filamentous fungi were found in the microbiome at ensiling and after aerobic exposure, whereas <i>Bacillus</i> spp. were the dominate bacteria after aerobic exposure. In conclusion, CT decreased protein degradation and improved the aerobic stability of silage. These desirable outcomes likely reflect the ability of PPC CT to inhibit those microorganisms involved in lowering silage quality and in the production of mycotoxins.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The present study reports the effects of condensed tannins on the complex microbial communities involved in ensiling and aerobic exposure of purple prairie clover. This study documents the ability of condensed tannins to lower mycotoxin production and the associated microbiome. Taxonomic bacterial community profiles were dominated by <i>Lactobacillales</i> after fermentation, with a notable increase in <i>Bacillus</i> spp. as a result of aerobic exposure. It is interesting to observe that condensed tannins decreased bacterial diversity during both ensiling and aerobic exposure but increased fungal diversity during aerobic exposure only. The present study indicates that the effects of condensed tannins on microbial communities lead to reduced lactic acid and total volatile fatty acid production, proteolysis, and mycotoxin concentration in the terminal silage and improved aerobic stability. Condensed tannins could be used as an additive to control unfavorable microbial development and maybe enhanced feed safety.
