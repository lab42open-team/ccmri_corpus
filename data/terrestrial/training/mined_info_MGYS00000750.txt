study_abstract	This study presented the eukaryotic diversity of the soil in Grove Mountains, East Antarctica, and provided reference for the investigating of the function of the Antarctic ecosystem. The Grove Mountains area, located in the interior of East Antarctica, is low in rain and temperature. Soil in this area came into shape slowly and formed cold desert soil. To investigate the microeukaryotic diversity of the cold desert soil from Grove Mountains, three soil samples were collected from the south of Mountain Harding during the 26th Chinese Antarctic scientific expedition. After pyrosequencing with a 454 Life Science GS-FLX sequencer, the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene sequences were analysed, the microeukaryotic diversity of soil from Grove Mountains was generally achieved.
