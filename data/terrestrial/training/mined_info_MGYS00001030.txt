study_name	Metatranscriptomic analyses of plant polymer breakdown in paddy soil
study_abstract	Paddy soil slurries were amended with rice straw and incubated for four weeks at 30C to mimick the early stage of rice straw breakdown. The anaerobic breakdown of rice straw was studied by metatranscriptomics to gain insights into changes in microbial community structure and gene expression. The focus was on methanogen dynamics and analysing glycosyl hydrolase expression.
