study_name	Pooled Ectomycorrhizal Root Tips Targeted Locus (Loci)
study_abstract	Soil cores were collected from 72 forest plots (20x40 m) evenly divided into four treatments (elevated pH, elevated P, elevated pH+P, and untreated control) across 2 physiographic regions of Ohio. Each region contained 36 plots within 3 forests. Within each plot, ten cores were sampled 1-m from the base of an adult tree. Cores were sieved to separate roots and soil and root tips that were visually confirmed to be colonized by ectomycorrhizal fungi were pooled into single composite samples for each plot. Genomic DNA was extracted from the pooled root tips from each plot and the primer set ITS1-F/ITS2 was used to amplify the ITS1 region of the rRNA gene. A set of 24 Multiplex Identifiers were used to separate sequence reads into treatment x forest x region combinations and sequencing was completed on the GS-FLX 454 System.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Many forests are affected by chronic acid deposition, which can lower soil pH and limit the availability of nutrients such as phosphorus (P), but the response of mycorrhizal fungi to changes in soil pH and P availability and how this affects tree acquisition of nutrients is not well understood. Here, we describe an ecosystem-level manipulation in 72 plots, which increased pH and/or P availability across six forests in Ohio, USA. Two years after treatment initiation, mycorrhizal fungi on roots were examined with molecular techniques, including 454-pyrosequencing. Elevating pH significantly increased arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonization and total fungal biomass, and affected community structure of AM and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi, suggesting that raising soil pH altered both mycorrhizal fungal communities and fungal growth. AM fungal taxa were generally negatively correlated with recalcitrant P pools and soil enzyme activity, whereas EcM fungal taxa displayed variable responses, suggesting that these groups respond differently to P availability. Additionally, the production of extracellular phosphatase enzymes in soil decreased under elevated pH, suggesting a shift in functional activity of soil microbes with pH alteration. Thus, our findings suggest that elevating pH increased soil P availability, which may partly underlie the mycorrhizal fungal responses we observed.
