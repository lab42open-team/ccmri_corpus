study_name	Environmental metagenomic interrogation of Thar desert microbial communities
study_abstract	Interrogation soil microbial community from arid and semiarid regions of the Thar Desert is essential. Until recently the studies on Thar desert soil microbes mostly focused on cultivation alone. Here we use culture independent approach. T-RFLP result shows that there is a significant difference among arid and semiarid soil bacterial communities, they clustered according to the sample type arid-soil, semi-arid soil, sand dune. Our clone library showed difference in the bacterial communities among arid-soil, semi-arid soil, sand dune respectively.
