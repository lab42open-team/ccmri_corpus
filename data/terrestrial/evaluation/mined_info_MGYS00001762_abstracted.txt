study_name	Metatranscriptomics analysis of a benzene-degrading enrichment culture under denitrifying conditions
study_abstract	Benzene is the risk-determining compound in oxygen-depleted subsurface environments contaminated by fuel hydrocarbons. Although anaerobic benzene degradation from benzoyl-CoA as a key aromatic central intermediate is well-known, the initial steps of benzene activation in absence of oxygen and its funneling towards benzoyl-CoA remains ill-defined. Here we conducted a metatranscriptomics analysis on biofilm and effluent samples obtained from a chemostat with an anaerobic benzene-degrading and nitrate-reducing culture that has been running for more than 14 years. The transcripts associated with strict anaerobic Firmicutes dominated all samples with 36.2-58.7% relative abundance. Among Firmicutes, members of Peptococcaceae comprised 21.5-36.3% relative abundance of the samples. A gene cluster containing genes encoding the proposed anaerobic benzene carboxylase (abcA and abcD) and a benzoate-coenzyme A ligase (bzlA) was found in the metatranscriptomic dataset that showed extraordinary similarity (> 96% at the amino acid level) and gene synteny to the proposed cluster encoding putative enzymes for direct benzene carboxylation to benzoate. Moreover, compared to the genes involved in downstream benzoyl-CoA degradation, the abcA and abcD and bzlA were among the highest transcripts with the abcA as the most transcribed gene. These results provide compelling evidence that benzene is directly carboxylated to benzoate by the products of abcAD genes and then ligated with CoA by the product of bzlA gene.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	In this study, we report transcription of genes involved in aerobic and anaerobic benzene degradation pathways in a benzene-degrading denitrifying continuous culture. Transcripts associated with the family Peptococcaceae dominated all samples (21-36% relative abundance) indicating their key role in the community. We found a highly transcribed gene cluster encoding a presumed anaerobic benzene carboxylase (AbcA and AbcD) and a benzoate-coenzyme A ligase (BzlA). Predicted gene products showed &gt;96% amino acid identity and similar gene order to the corresponding benzene degradation gene cluster described previously, providing further evidence for anaerobic benzene activation via carboxylation. For subsequent benzoyl-CoA dearomatization, bam-like genes analogous to the ones found in other strict anaerobes were transcribed, whereas gene transcripts involved in downstream benzoyl-CoA degradation were mostly analogous to the ones described in facultative anaerobes. The concurrent transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in oxygenase-mediated aerobic benzene degradation suggested oxygen presence in the culture, possibly formed via a recently identified nitric oxide dismutase (Nod). Although we were unable to detect transcription of Nod-encoding genes, addition of nitrite and formate to the continuous culture showed indication for oxygen production. Such an oxygen production would enable aerobic microbes to thrive in oxygen-depleted and nitrate-containing subsurface environments contaminated with hydrocarbons.
