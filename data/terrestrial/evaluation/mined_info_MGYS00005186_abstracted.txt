study_name	Impact of rainforest transformation on phylogenetic and functional diversity of soil prokaryotic communities in Sumatra (Indonesia)
study_abstract	This project investigates the impact of lowland rainforest transformation on diversity and ecosystem function of soil prokaryotic communities. To identify changes in indigenous prokaryotic community composition accompanying rainforest transformation, comparative phylogenetic analyses of soil samples from lowland rainforest, jungle rubber, rubber plantations, and oil palm plantations were performed.

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	Palm oil production in Indonesia increased constantly over the last decades, which led to massive deforestation, especially on Sumatra island. The ongoing conversion of rainforest to agricultural systems results in high biodiversity loss. Here, we present the first RNA-based study on the effects of rainforest transformation to rubber and oil palm plantations in Indonesia for the active soil bacterial communities. For this purpose, bacterial communities of three different converted systems (jungle rubber, rubber plantation, and oil palm plantation) were studied in two landscapes with rainforest as reference by RT-PCR amplicon-based analysis of 16S rRNA gene transcripts. Active soil bacterial communities were dominated by <i>Frankiales</i> (<i>Actinobacteria</i>), subgroup 2 of the <i>Acidobacteria</i> and <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> (mainly <i>Rhizobiales</i> and <i>Rhodospirillales</i>). Community composition differed significantly between the converted land use systems and rainforest reference sites. <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> decreased significantly in oil palm samples compared to rainforest samples. In contrast, relative abundances of taxa within the <i>Acidobacteria</i> increased. Most important abiotic drivers for shaping soil bacterial communities were pH, calcium concentration, base saturation and C:N ratio. Indicator species analysis showed distinct association patterns for the analyzed land use systems. Nitrogen-fixing taxa including members of <i>Rhizobiales</i> and <i>Rhodospirillales</i> were associated with rainforest soils while nitrifiers and heat-resistant taxa including members of <i>Actinobacteria</i> were associated with oil palm soils. Predicted metabolic profiles revealed that the relative abundances of genes associated with fixation of nitrogen significantly decreased in plantation soils. Furthermore, predicted gene abundances regarding motility, competition or gene transfer ability indicated rainforest conversion-induced changes as well.
