study_name	Malaysia Pasoh Landuse Logged Forest
study_abstract	In Malaysia and much of Southeast Asia the major drivers of deforestation are logging and expansion of oil palm agriculture. Forests regenerating from logging have been found to support relatively high levels of biodiversity for some larger taxa, while oil palm plantations have been shown to harbor a very small fraction of biodiversity that would otherwise be observed in primary forest. However, no studies have evaluated the belowground communities in these mosaics across the tropical landscape.
