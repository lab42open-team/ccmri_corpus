study_name	Hauturu temperate rainforest soil environmental sequencing using targeted loci (16S, 18S, ITS, COI and trnL)
study_abstract	From 20 soil samples we amplified DNA from five molecular markers (16S, 18S, ITS, COI and trnL) using targeted-locus next generation sequencing. Our aim was to evaluate a suite of DNA markers coupled with next generation sequencing (NGS) that span the tree of life and compare these data to traditional biodiversity monitoring tools, including mist-netting and call counts for birds, vegetation surveys, and invertebrate collection with DNA barcoding. Our sampling regime consisted of ten 20x20 metre plots, each comprising sixteen 5x5 metre sub-plots along a 700 metre elevational gradient on a temperate island forest ecosystem (Hauturu, New Zealand).

publication_nr_0_pubmed_abstract	There is an increasing demand for rapid biodiversity assessment tools that have a broad taxonomic coverage. Here we evaluate a suite of environmental DNA (eDNA) markers coupled with next generation sequencing (NGS) that span the tree of life, comparing them with traditional biodiversity monitoring tools within ten 20x20 meter plots along a 700 meter elevational gradient. From six eDNA datasets (one from each of 16S, 18S, ITS, trnL and two from COI) we identified sequences from 109 NCBI taxonomy-defined phyla or equivalent, ranging from 31 to 60 for a given eDNA marker. Estimates of alpha and gamma diversity were sensitive to the number of sequence reads, whereas beta diversity estimates were less sensitive. The average within-plot beta diversity was lower than between plots for all markers. The soil beta diversity of COI and 18S markers showed the strongest response to the elevational variation of the eDNA markers (COI: r=0.49, p&lt;0.001; 18S: r=0.48, p&lt;0.001). Furthermore pairwise beta diversities for these two markers were strongly correlated with those calculated from traditional vegetation and invertebrate biodiversity measures. Using a soil-based eDNA approach, we demonstrate that standard phylogenetic markers are capable of recovering sequences from a broad diversity of eukaryotes, in addition to prokaryotes by 16S. The COI and 18S eDNA markers are the best proxies for aboveground biodiversity based on the high correlation between the pairwise beta diversities of these markers and those obtained using traditional methods.
