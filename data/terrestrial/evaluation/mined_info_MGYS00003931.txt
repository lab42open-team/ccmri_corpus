study_name	Plasma soil pretreatment trail
study_abstract	Plasma is the fourth state of matter and it can be generated by coupling sufficient quantities of energy to a gas to induce ionization. Plasma treatment is known for its antimicrobial properties by generating agents such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to kill and reduce proliferation of various microorganisms. Here, we examine an effect of plasma exposure on soil samples. Various exposure times and plasma properties were tested. Microbial communities of soil samples were examined by sequencing ribosomal 16S gene and comparing abundance of different microbial groups in treated and non-treated samples.
