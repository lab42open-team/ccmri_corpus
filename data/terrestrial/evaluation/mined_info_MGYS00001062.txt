study_name	RDX degrading microbial communities
study_abstract	RDX degrading enrichments were obtained using four different agricultural soils as innocula. The total genomic DNA samples extracted from the communities after two amendments of 20 mg/L of RDX was degraded, was subjected to high throughput amplicon sequencing. Time zero total genomic DNA samples of the agricultural soils were also sequenced.
