study_abstract	Different ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) colonize seedlings in clearcuts versus intact forests. We were curious whether the shift in EMF community was associated with a change in the ability to access nutrients from soil organic matter, as measured by extracellular enzyme (EE) activities. Previous work in our lab had demonstrated that EMF identity can be more important than soil nutrient status and site in determining EE activities of ectomycorrhizal roots. Hence, we hypothesized that EE profiles associated with seedlings regenerating naturally in clearcuts would differ from those in adjacent forests. To test this hypothesis, naturally-regenerated subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) seedlings were reciprocally transplanted between three pairs of clearcut and forest plots. One growing season after transplantation, EMF communities on seedlings originating from clearcuts and forests still differed from each other, regardless of whether they had been transplanted into clearcuts or forests. Activities of eight EE were measured on randomly-selected, individual mycorrhizal tips of transplanted seedlings. Contrary to our hypothesis, enzyme profiles were most similar among seedlings planted in the same destination, regardless of origin. Given that the EMF community depended on the site of origin, our results suggest that ectomycorrhizas exhibit a range of physiological attributes with respect to EE activities.
