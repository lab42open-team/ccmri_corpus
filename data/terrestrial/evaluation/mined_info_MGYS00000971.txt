study_name	a paddy soil chronosequence genome sequencing
study_abstract	In this study, we investigated how bacterial communities might change with respect to soil physicochemical development during 2000-year rice cultivation after reclamation from tidal wetlands, using the soil chronosequence in the Yangtze River Delta, China. This knowledge would provide useful suggestions for sustainable development of paddy ecosystem.
