study_name	Silver-induced disturbance increases diversity in soil microbial communities and selects for persistent/resistant phenotypes.
study_abstract	Silver-induced microbial selective pressure is becoming increasingly relevant due to the concurrent increase in biomedical uses of silver and its mass commercialisation in antibacterial consumer products. With demonstrated links between environmental resistomes and clinical pathogens it is important to identify microorganisms with the propensity for silver tolerance/resistance. This study investigated the effects of ionic Ag stress on total soil bacterial communities (a potential source of resistant phenotypes) and identified resistant/persistant populations to the near species level. Silver treatments of 50 - 400 mg Ag kg-1 soil were established in five soils. Chemical profiling using Diffusive Gradients in Thin-film devices confirmed that effective Ag selective pressure was operating throughout the 9 month incubation period, albeit with decreasing intensity. X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy showed this was due to changes in Ag speciation to less soluble forms such as Ag0 and Ag2S. Real-time quantitative PCR and Illumina MiSeq partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene were used to determine the effects on bacterial diversity and population dynamics, and to identify persistent/resistant populations using both taxonomy-based and operational taxonomic unit approaches. Structural bacterial community changes occurred in all soils. 16S rRNA gene counts and a-diversity were inversely related, with the former showing immediate significant reductions following Ag application which persisted in some soils but recovered in others. These effects were influenced more by exposure time than applied Ag dose. Dominant taxa in Ag-exposed samples included a range of known persister species (mostly gram positive), including metal tolerant bacteria and slow growing Mycobacteria.
