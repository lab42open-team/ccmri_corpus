study_name	Soil microcosms amended with 13C wheat Targeted Locus
study_abstract	To identify soil bacteria assimilating carbon from whole plants, we incubated soil from (cattle) pasture and natural beech forest with 13C-labelled wheat roots in microcosms for 72 hours. The degradation of the plant material was followed by measuring total CO2 and 13CO2. Pyrosequencing of density-resolved 16S rRNA identified soil bacteria involved in the assimilation of carbon from wheat residues.
